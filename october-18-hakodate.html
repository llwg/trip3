<p>Today was October 18. We plan to, in the morning, visit a shopping center with a Uniqlo and Book-Off to visit those.</p>
<p>So in morning i checked out, take bus to shopping center. walk around, all shops dont open to like 9:30am i think?. so parking lot empty. everything very empty. Wait for friend. Walk around the area, not much to see. Got a “hot cocoa” drink from warm vending that i drank a little and end up dump in a restroom sink later bc i dont rlly like.</p>
<p>Eventually friend arrived. For breakfast decided to eat at SEICOMART across the street (there wasnt many restaurants close in area). the SEICOMART had a HOT CHEF section = i think basically just a heated-foods section. I had rice ball and some fried-chicken-in-cup. We squatted in the smoking section outside of the store eating the food with ground as table. it was sunny and nice. Friend left when someone came over and started smoking.</p>

</figure>
<p>We put all the e.g. rice ball plastic wrappers in the fried-chicken cup and friend went back inside to throw it away and also buy a coffee i think.</p>
<p>Then went to the shopping center. Then we either went to the TSURUHA DRUG or the UNIQLO. i dont actually remember which went first. So i will just describe the two stores separately.</p>
<section id="tsuruha-drug" class="aside">
<h2>TSURUHA DRUG</h2>
<p>i first went in bc i wanted to use bathroom i think. friend stayed outside.</p>
<p>I circled around store and realised bathroom was at front of store. but also i was looking for some e.g. lotion to put on my heels bc they is cracked. but i didnt find the section of products with that. So i just exited store without using bathroom or getting lotion.</p>
<p>Friend say they was staying outside bc they was holding a can of drink that they said didnt want to seem like they stole. So i put they drink in my bag and we walked inside. They was looking for some kind of anti-motion-sickness drug because we was taking a boat later in the day. I continued to look for lotion things.</p>
<p>I found the lotion stuff but every single product i looked at had preservatives in them. idk why. even the vaseline had BHT. like why do you need BHT in vaseline. idk. But vaseline had the simplest ingredients list so i just bought that. Friend was still looking for this one specific drug and so showed it to someone and then that person went over to somewhere and got help of some other ppl who ig concluded they dont have it and communicated that they dont have it with making X with their arms. So we left the store. And then think: what if it ask for general motion-sickness drug in general. So friend go back in and i follow them and show them a translator screen “do you have motion-sickness drug” to cashier and cashier went over to drug person and drug person showed us their recommended drug and friend bought that drug. And we left. And also I used the bathroom. At some time.</p>

<h2>UNIQLO</h2>
<p>Today Uniqlo was releasing some new pants so i went and bought the new pants and a belt and shirt. I brought three sizes of same pants, two diff shirts, and belt to fitting room for a total of six items. I didnt know that they was gonna care about the number of items bc the only other japan fitting-room experience i experienced before didnt care. However i saw in front of me (friend went in before me) that they did care. And then i looked at the sign that was only in japanese that seemed to say “pls only bring 5 items in” so i thought, oops!. And then worker came out and said “oh ur doing 5 items right” i think and i didnt say anything and just acted like umm i guess? idk japanese. and went in.</p>
<p>Spent a long time in the fitting room contemplating which size of pants to get and also dreading having to exit the fitting room. But eventually exited it with all the stuff and there was no extra dialogue or interaction, just put my clothes back (idk if i was supposed to hand them back if i wasnt gonna buy them). And i thought a bit more and eventually bought my pants and belt and shirt and exited store with friend.</p>
</section>
<p>And went to book-off where friend browsed things and bought a thing.</p>
<p>Then it was time to go to take a boat (Ferry) and also eat lunch. Take a bus, got off the bus, went to go eat lunch at a place friend found on google maps.</p>
<p>The menu was all in japanese but i think it was a soba place. i had some soba and a <ruby>tendon<rt>天丼</rt></ruby> it was pretty good i guess though literally first time ive had both. At the end of meal they brought sth out we didnt know what it was. Friend looked it up and apparently was noodle water u can drink. I drank some with the noodle sauce and it was pretty tasty.</p>

<p>Some guy accidentally dropped they coin underneath register i remember. That was memorable. And we paid for food and left. I used another of my 2000-yen bills, nothing happened.</p>
<p>Walk over to the ferry terminal. Friend initiated dialogue with the counter person. They handed us a sheet with highlighted fields to fill out, like passport number for each passenger and um yeah maybe home address? i dont rlly remember. but i filled it out and gave it to person and then um they collected my payment i think and gave us a ticket for two ppl and an information sheet in english with instructions when to board the ship and stuff.</p>
<p>We waited in the waiting room. there was vending machines, i think i bought and drank a can of juice. And also a smoking room i didnt smoke, and bathroom which i used. And a TV. it was quite warm i remember.</p>
<p>Time arrived to board. Info sheet say to wait for announcement to go board ferry but seemed like other ppl were walking over to go board ferry so we just went to go board ferry.</p>
<p>The main hull(?) of ferry was transporting vehicles i think. We walk up to the worker person and show ticket, they rip off the boarding part of the ticket and let us through into the big ferry boat thing where all the vehicles driving in to park. The human passengers walk up set of stairs.</p>
<p>Walk around the passenger area, there was e.g. cup noodles and snack and drink vending machines and bathrooms and etc.</p>
<p>There was also some flat rooms where ppl sitting/lying down. They was labelled “2nd class” which was kinda confusing bc it was not apparent what class we were. However it seemed like there were enough of them and enough ppl was in them that we were probably something like 2nd class, so i went into one sat down, and friend followed.</p>
<p>there was outlets can charge ur stuff. i lied down and covered eyes took a little nap maybe, maybe for like one hour. Got up and walked around. I bought a little snack which was KAMEDANOKAKINOTANE which i discovered has peanuts and i am allergic to peanuts and friend didnt want to eat the peanuts so i just ate all the rice crackers and put the remainder in pocket to throw away later. and also drank some HASKAP-flavored water. i guess haskap is a big thing in hokkaido idk.</p>

<p>Then i went outside on the deck to observe the sunset (or set sun) and it was pretty cool. i sent a picture to friend who then came out and took some photos and i also took some photos.</p>

<p>We then arrived at destination, AOMORI city. We checked into our respective people’s hotels (was staying separate hotels again) and then met up to go eat food. Was decided to go to some sushi place. Friend read some review like they may discriminate against ppl that use english menu or sth?? oopsies. But went in anyways.</p>
<p>Um got seated. and then like one of the first things the server asks us if if we’re <ruby>japanese<rt>日本の方</rt></ruby> (in japanese). And then where we’re from i think. Which was interesting maybe. And then they gave us some menus, both english and friend said oh japanese also ok ^^ and also take the japanese menu. I think they asked us what drinks we want bc i think we probably were obliged to order a drink. They also layed out like um chopsticks and small dishes or sth. I think friend touched they chopsticks while person was laying them out and person was like Oh <ruby>そのままで^^<rt>leave it bro</rt></ruby>. Idk and i have never studied sushi-place etiquette which im guessing probably should have before coming. And also i remember that we left the menus flat on the table without figuring out that theres like a stand for them on the side of the tables that most japanese restaurants have i think. So the server like took the menus while struggling to put all the stuff on the table and put it in the slot for us, which made me realize we didnt do it. oops!.</p>
<p>But anyways we ordered some stuff and ate it. The fish umm idk convenience-store sushi is still my top-tier sushi ive had japan. idk why it just hits different. this sushi place was the first “sushi place” ive had in japan and it was tbh underwhelming esp for the price. idk maybe its supposed to be more of an experience which we did not rlly have bc we didnt study what the experience was supposed to be beforehand, probably. Or maybe i just dont know how to taste raw fish. Or maybe they purposely gave us the worst fish they had bc they thought we were dumb tourists who wouldnt appreciate the fish anyway. no idea!.</p>

<p>We left restaurant returned to hotels, I washed and went to sleep</p>
<section id="nice-bathroom" class="aside">
<h2>nice bathroom</h2>
<p>this hotel had a nice bathroom. What i mean by Nice Bathroom is there is separate bath-room with the like um bathtub and shower room and drain and the whole room is meant to be wet. I think the hotel the day before-before also had nice bathroom but i dont know. i only know that this hotel was nice bc i took a picture of it to remember it. I like these kinds of bath rooms. very nice.</p>
