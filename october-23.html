<p>At some point yesterday or today I decided i wanted to go to NOBEOKA. Why? because it look like it would have nice beaches. So I woke up and went to the station. Then I wondered where exactly to buy ticket for the train I wanted to take.</p>
<p>It turns out there was a ticket machine, and it was essentially like buying shinkansen ticket, but it is not a shinkansen. I paid with credit card at the machine.</p>
<p>I enter the gate and go to the platform. However there is no train that says is bound for NOBEOKA, there is only one for SAIKI which is one stop before NOBEOKA. However the platform and departure time align exactly with what google maps says so i just board this train.</p>
<p>The train got a fold-out table, i ate a sausage bread, rice ball, and some juice I bought at a convenience store at some time that morning, I don’t really remember but I think it had a self-register.</p>

<h2>ticket guy</h2>
<p>There was a guy that walked around and checked peoples tickets. I have never experienced that taking a train in Japan but it happened here. I just handed them mine and i believe it was already punched by the electronic gate i went through ? so they just say thx hand it back i think. and put it in the ticket holder thing on the seat in front of me. I think i saw them punch someone elses ticket idk what was up with that bc i thought you would have needed to go through gate to board train. not sure.</p>

<section id="haircut" class="aside">
<h2>haircut</h2>
<p>I thought about getting a haircut in Japan. Specifically I planned yesterday to maybe get one this morning. And that did not happen. So I thought to get one when I arrived in later destination. That never happened either. I did not get a haircut in Japan.</p>
</section>
<p>I also hear in the announcements i believe that the train was only going to SAIKI due to heavy rain. Don’t go to NOBEOKA. Hmm. so I think what to do. Maybe I could stay in SAIKI and maybe tomorrow train service resume. Or maybe not. idked. There seemed to be no bus from SAIKI to NOBEOKA. Hmm. Eventually, I decided to instead get off at KOKURA where i could transfer to shinkansen going the opposite way.</p>
<p>I got off at KOKURA. I put my ticket into the electronic gate and it rejected it. so I stood around. I put it into a fare adjustment machine which didnt work. And so I went to where I knew I would eventually have to go which was the ticket ppl window next to the gates.</p>
<p>I show the ticket to them and they remarked sth like oh yeah it got that heavy rain. They went in the back and did something i think come back. And they also pull up translator and had me select what language i wanted and started typing Japanese into it to give me message. That was interesting because I experience ppl using translators before but they all spoke into the translator, not type.</p>
<p>Overall they told me i think in some mix of spoken japanese and also translated text something like Yeah trains not going there. The next trains are at blahblah time. But they might not actually go fully there.</p>
<p>I pulled out my phone text translator type in english to translate to Japanese: can I just get out here.</p>
<p>And then they reply in translated text: Do you still use the ticket? which confused me. and they added: Can do refund. which made sense (i believe they were asking if i wanted to keep my ticket to nobeoka to go later). I affirmed the refund, and they went and did something and gave me a cash refund and I left. based on eyeballing the amount i think assume they calcluate refunded the amount from KOKURA to NOBEOKA which makes sense.</p>
<p>I waked around Kokura station a bit, i think used the bathroom, and then entered a starbucks entrance and put something in their trash can. And then I went to buy shinkansen ticket.</p>
<p>I bought it and then board the train. I ride the train to the last stop, KAGOSHIMA-CHUUO. I do not really remember what my plan or intention was, but I remember i was looking google maps on the train and i saw there was a nice-looking beach, and i got off at KAGOSHIMA station.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>I walk to the beach. It was pleasantly warm. The walk to the beach was not particularly nice, just on sidewalks next to car road. There was not much to see either. There was um like a mos burger, and a giant golfing thing with the huge nets surrounding it. But on the right side i could see: Sakurajima. which is a big volcano. It looked cool.</p>
<p>Eventually reached a water-access point that looked like if i walk along it i reach the beach. So i climb over the pole barrier thing and accessed the water.</p>
<p>It was nice, some rocks. A calm bay waters. Walk along there. Big volcano.</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/20241023_122249.webp" alt="" /><figcaption>big volcano with its top obscured by clouds</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Reach the sandy part of the beach. There were some people there. I look up where to eat lunch. There was a food place nearby. So I walk to it. Exit beach, rinse off feet at a water station. Walk along the road to there. There was this really strange crossing i had to do to cross the road, where like there was no crosswalk, but theres a train level crossing which i think cars have to stop at before going. so i sort of crossed the road.. at the level crossing.. while cars were stopping and going. idrk what was going on but i crossed the road.</p>
<p>I arrived at the restaurant, found my way inside. Idrk what I was doing. They had something that looked like a wait list. Idk if I was supposed to put my name on it because it didnt seem like there was any wait. and also i couldnt read the japanese instructions. But I put my name on it anyways i think. And also they had a sink where i washed my hands.</p>
<p>Someone guided me to a seat and i think told me to ring bell once want to order. I looked at one of the menus and saw Sukiyaki which seemed cool ive never had that before. So I rang bell someone come over, i order the sukiyaki.</p>
<p>Wait for a while for food. The place kinda seemed understaffed, idrk why. Maybe it was my imagination. Eventually they brought over food. and also mentioned that water was over there i think. I got some water.</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/20241023_125922.webp" alt="" /><figcaption>first sukiyaki</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I ate the food at a leisurely pace. hot pot stuff dipped in raw egg does taste pretty good imo.</p>
<p>There was not many people in restaurant when first arrived but while eating gain quite a bustling atmosphere. A bustling family-restaurant vibes. One thing i noticed was that ppl chatting sounded different. like some bits sounded like japanese and i was convinced that what i was hearing was some kind of japanese, but it sounded different. especially the older people. It was interesting and first time i ever noticed hearing a diverse japanese sounds irl.</p>
<p>I slowly finished meal and also looking on my phone wondering what im gonna do after this. Take train east perhaps? I did not know.</p>
<p>I decide to first leave restaurant. I bring my receipt to front, pay, leave. I go back to beach where i came from. I sat down on beach. I looked at SAKURAJIMA, but mostly at phone wondering what to do next.</p>

<p>Some point I looked at plane tickets. I saw the cheapest flight out of KOJ (KAGOSHIMA) would be tomorrow. idrk about other airports like OITA if i leave kagoshima go east or sth. But i simply decided then to leave kagoshima tomorrow. The flight price was reason, but i think also other reasons, for example it felt like trip was almost already over so should not spend time in new unknown places, and also should probably meet friend and enjoy things that cannot be as enjoyed alone.</p>
<p>So i book flight to TOKYO tomorrow, and also a hotel in Kagoshima city area for tonight. And for the remainder of the day I decide that I would take the ferry to SAKURAJIMA because i saw theres a ferry.</p>
<p>Walked over to the SAKURAJIMA ferry port, which was back the way i came from the KAGOSHIMA station. I took a more inland path, which had some parks. There was not a lot of anyone in these parks.</p>
<p>Walk in the ferry port. I barely missed the departing ferry i think. However it ran like every twenty minutes during the day. So I wait. There was an aquarium entrance where i wait. There was also like two small shops, and a bathroom, and some vending machines.</p>
<p>Time to board ferry, board ferry. There were not many people on the ferry compared to its size. I stood alone on the top deck that face towards not-sakurajima.</p>
<p>The ferry arrive and get off the ferry. The ferry fare was paid inside the SAKURAJIMA terminal once you get off (arriving) or before you get on (departing).</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>I am at the SAKURAJIMA now but idrk what to do. So i look on google map. There is some busses. I wait for a bus, idk what bus to take or where to go.</p>
<p>On google maps I see some kind of walking trail or some kind of water access idrk. So I decide to take bus to around there.</p>
<p>Bus come. People get on and I get on with them. Bus do not use “Suica” IC card it seemed. But there was also no ticket to pull out hmm.. I see someone get on without doing anything. So I do that also. I soon realize that it is probably a flat-rate bus so can just pay when get off without any ticket i think.</p>
<p>I get off at a stop. I use the change machine successfully, pay, get off.</p>
<p>There was a hill you can observe something on, so I walked up the stairs. There did not seem like much to observe and also there was someone there, so I walked back down. Right across the road there was the walking path thing that I saw on google maps. So I walked on the walking path.</p>
<p>Somewhere along the walking path there seemed to be a little offroad path where you could access the shore. So I walked into there and ended up at the shore, which was a bunch of black im guessing lava rocks.</p>
<p>There was some crabs living in the rocks and stuff growing on the rocks some places. I scrambled along the rocks westward along the shore.</p>
<p>There was water and it was nice. Sometimes the rocks was slippery or unstable so that felt a little dangerous but i used my hands and was not bad, except a little scrape I got at one point. And also i think that I had some kind of dreams this night about falling and breaking my limbs.</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/20241023_163312.webp" alt="" /><figcaption>wow cool</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Enjoy the bay waters and sometime climb up sit on a big rocks enjoy the scenery. Could saw big volcano behind me for a while, Then see cityscape in west.</p>
<p>Sun was setting in the west which kind of shone directly into my eyes because i was headed westward which was slightly inconvenient.</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/20241023_171841.webp" alt="" /><figcaption>sun setting over the city</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>According to picture timestamps I probably played in the rocks for like 1.25 hours. I then found an exit back to the walking path and continued walking westward, just on the walking path.</p>

<p>The sun had now set. I saw several cats. Walking back to the ferry terminal.</p>
<p>Along the way I passed by a thing that google maps said was an ONSEN and it had google reviews from foreign tourists and also someone mentioned you just have to use a ticket machine i think so it seemed doable. So I went in. The entrance was take your shoes off and i was wearing sandals with no socks and seemed kinda weird to walk in barefoot so i put on socks before walking in. There was a vending machine so i purchased 1 Adult from it. So I got the ticket. and i saw they had the towels behind counter. So I prepared some money to exchange for towel. And I went up to counter and handed person my ticket. and they communicated sth like “whats the money for” and i tried to say something like “Towel” (but in japanese). And realised I had the wrong amount of money. So I adjusted it while the person existed behind the counter. And they gave me towel. And also showed me some information sheet about how to use onsen and i said OK and went into the bath.</p>
<p>It was my first ONSEN experience. it was essentially just like public bath, you go in shower and then bathe and then thats it. google reviews i think mentioned the bath got a good view of the bay, but there was other ppl and did not feel very comfortable looking around, and it was dark outside anyways. and the windows were quite fogged up.</p>
<p>I did not particularly notice any difference between a regular bath, like it didnt really smell different. And it was pretty dark and the tiles were dark color so couldnt really see color of water.</p>
<p>I bathed a little and got out and took a sip from the water fountain and back into changing room where i had left my towel. Dry self, and then wondered where i should put my used towel. There did not seem to be like any Used Towel Collection bin so what do i do with it??. I spent some time trying to look up how onsen work. I concluded that maybe i should just leave it in my upright-facing-bin and theyll deal with it when um sorting out the bins. idrked. Or did I actually buy the entire towel so I should take it? I did not know. But I left it in my upright bin and left.</p>
<p>I reached ferry terminal and took it back to Kagoshima City Place. From there i walked to.. a tram station! wow a tram yes.</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/20241023_193331.webp" alt="" /><figcaption>this is what the streetcar looked like</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The tram came and i boarded the tram. It did not take Suica IC card as well i believe (idk how I knew; I am pretty sure I never actually tried). But also there was no ticket to pull. So that was quite confusing and I just got on and had a seat and see that it is a flat-fare ride. But also I think I saw someone who had just got on go to front and use change machine. Idk if they was also submitting their fare. So I was slightly worried that I should have paid the flat fare as soon as I got on. But as more people got on and did not immediately scan a card or pay fare at front, I assumed I was good.</p>
<section id="rapica" class="aside">
<h2>RapiCa</h2>
<p>I discovered over time that Kagoshima has its own IC card and does not accept other IC card in many most places, e.g. the bus I took and this tram, and later others.</p>
<p>Interesting , first time I had been to a place with similar situation (its own IC card and dont use others).</p>
</section>
<p>Tram get kinda crowded. But less crowded when approaching my stop. But to not repeat what happened to me in HAKODATE tram I got up beforehand and slowly move to front of tram.</p>
<p>Drop my coins in the fare box get off. idrk how the fare box even works and what happens if you put in the insufficient fare and get off while its still processing, like does the driver say bro no come back idk.</p>
<p>I walking to hotel. I looked up that there are some food on the way. Walk through the dark streets. I stop by the one food place I saw looked possible. But in person it was on the second floor, and the menu looked complicated and vibes intimidating. And also they closed in like 30 mins i think so idk if rude go in especially with those vibes.</p>
<p>So I continue on. Was thinking going to MOS BURGER. But then happened to see a “Tantanmen” place right next to hotel on google maps. It looked yummy and easy-to-comprehend menu. So I intended to go there.</p>
<p>I try to walk to it and got actually lost and confused in a giant parking lot with partitions and stuff. I thought I could walk through the parking lot but the fences and stuff were confusing and ended up basically just walking around it. It was a huge parking lot.</p>
<p>Eventually arrived at the TANTANMEN place. i walked in behind a person which was great to have comfort of being able to see the precedent. But also I was initially mistaken for a second person in their party of one.</p>
<p>I become seated, they give menu. I order um their Tantan-soup-noodles and a CHUUKADON. Server takes menu back. I accidentally dropped something out of my pocket and server says oops u dropped sth bro pick it up hand it to me thank you. Tantanmen come, then the Chuukadon. The tantanmen was pretty good but the Chuukadon was cool because it looks exactly what u always see depicted as Chuuka=Chinese food in japan imo. it also tasted good.</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/20241023_204528.webp" alt="" /><figcaption>tyuukadon</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Eat all the food and get up and go. I pay with the exact money. The person who handling my payment was also my server and say something like “CHOUZU DESU NE ok thx!” or something and i go. That person was nice and i did not feel too afraid to eat in that restaurant because they gave off friendly vibes. thank you that person. Also idked and wondered what CHOUZU means. I remember that “Exact” was something like CHOUDO which sounds kinda similar and i wonder if they was related.</p>
<p>Walk over to the hotel next door check in. I got a breakfast voucher nice cool!. The hotel was kinda big and resort-like vibes like where you might take ur family if you go on a vacation all together. That impression might be because when i going to my room i saw small child run around im guessing with they family taking a vacation. Also the hotel felt kind of vintagey, an interesting and slightly memorable vibe. Also the toilet had like a joystick-like stick flusher which is probably one of only times i saw that variety of flusher in my time in japan i think. Also they had a radio built into the nightstand.</p>
<p>Since i just came from onsen i did not wash i believe. just brush teeth and then went to sleep i think.</p>
<section id="when-i-was-craving-alcohol" class="aside">
<h2>when I was craving alcohol</h2>
<p>I was kind of craving alcohol that night. So I left hotel room to go up to the floor marked as Vending to see if they have alcohol vending. Elevator came. an old guy step out and i step in. And then the guy said i think like: oh wait what floor (is this?) (or something along those lines) (stepped back into elevator). oh oops 7th floor (he was going to 8th floor) mb. and then he rode up to 8th floor and got off. There was no alcohol in the vending machines. So I did not drink any.</p>
