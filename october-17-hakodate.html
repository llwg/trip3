<p>I woke up some time before friend so i went out on a morning walk. I walked around some harbor area. Saw water, and some interesting-looking touristy(?) street or so.</p>

<p>Friend eventually woke up text, agree to meet some time around 10pm to eat at LUCKY PIERROT restaurant. For now could eat something small for breakfast. I was quite hungry.</p>
<p>I passed by some some place looked interesting, i think it was bento-place. However i walked inside for 30 seconds and it looked intimidating and no english text, so i walked out.</p>
<p>I walked to a convenience store and bought a tuna-salad bread and a um jelly-like vitamin drink in pouch for breakfast. When waiting behind the person in front of me for checkout i noted that this convenience store you would select your payment method via the customer-facing kiosk and do the payment through that. The person also asked me <ruby>SONOMAMADEIINDESKA<rt>そのままでいいんですか</rt></ruby> ig to confirm if i didnt need bag and maybe to not microwave bread or sth (do you microwave tuna-salad?), To which i used all my japanese skills to maybe say <ruby>Yeah<rt>はい</rt></ruby>. or maybe i just nonverbally affirmed. And then they pulled over this tray of what seemed like drink samples and then explained to me this very long dialogue i tbh had no clue what they were saying but i assumed it was about feel free to take a sample and if you want um over there something something what?? idk. Anyway i got a free drink sample (i think it was free?) and left the store i had no clue what happened.</p>
<p>I ate my free sample and tuna salad and vitamin gummy water on a bench. A cat passed by me and meowed.</p>

<p>Then i took a streetcar to get back to hotel area!. Streetcar very cool. first time i have been on one, maybe in any country. It was essentially like Bus on Tracks. In the streetcar there was lots of seemed like tourists, perhaps from a cruise ship i saw docked in the harbor. not too sure.</p>
<p>Streetcar was cool but became crowded and i had to squeeze myself to front when my stop came, and i think driver was closing doors when i showed up at front and someone asked like oh ur getting off?orso. and maybe i affirmed somehow i dont really remember. and beeped my IC card and got off.</p>
<p>And then i had to take another bus. Or at least thats what google maps told me i just followed google maps. maybe it would have been same time to just walk not sure.</p>
<p>Eventually met up with friend and walked to a LUCKY PIERROT restaurant where we spent a while outside looking and deciding menu. And enter the LUCKY PIERROT restaurant. The restaurant had quite a lack of any english. Friend was the one ordering. There was a bit of confusion i think esp bc friend order nonalcohol beer orso and person was not understanding and/or the nonalcohol beer on the japanese menu was not actually called “nonalcohol” beer but a specific one called “all free”. And after finish order and stuff, worker presented us with some slip of paper in chinese but neither of our persons know chinese so i said sth like “umm (english)[英語で]” to which they just gave us the japanese version (i dont think they had an english version) and said sth like “table number”. i think we had to write our table number there we wanted on there. and i assume our order number? i dont really remember. but we did that and put in the collection dish.</p>
<p>The food arrived and the person did the same “is that all you ordered?” line and then collected the number-sign thing we brought to our table.</p>
<p>The food was a lot of food. It was burger and omurice for each person but the portion was very large. I barely finished my stuff (which included some fries). The burger was their signature burger i believe which is named “<ruby>Chinese Chicken Burger<rt>チャイニーズチキンバーガー</rt></ruby>”. like its literally named like “Chinese Chicken Burger” transliterated into japanese. And if you have ever eaten american-chinese food Breaded-Chicken-With-Sauce dish, it tasted like that. Chinese Chicken put into burger bun. It was quite interesting.</p>

<p>After the meal, decide to make a trip to Hakodate MEGA Don Quijote because before the trip friend and i looked at it on google maps pictures and one of the interior views looked very impressional. So we went there, by um streetcar, and bus.</p>
<p>Looked at some stuff inside. I remember i bought a barely tea and i think a vitamin-c drink from a vending machine in it. Look at the view we wanted to see. Looked through a DAISO. i think i was feeling quite tired, still adjusting to jetlag at that point.</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/20241017_131255.webp" alt="" /><figcaption>this was the view we wanted to see</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Eventually left and walked to a large bus stop. Here, friend and i took separate buses. Friend and i booked separate hotels because perhaps more convenient given our waking-up schedule gap, and also we plan to meet at night and have lamb barbequeue for dinner and i would drink alcohol and friend said i snored loudly after i drank alcohol.</p>
<p>So i took bus to somewhere labelled on google maps as HOKUTO where i had booked my hotel.</p>
<p>However after i got off at the area and walked around i realized that my hotel was not in the area at all. I walked up towards a train station and saw a train passing by. Checking the schedule I realised that was the last train that would come in like 2 hours.</p>
<p>So i walked back down to a bus stop to wait for a bus back to hakodate city area. The streets was quite quiet, only interrupted by some political car(s) driving around with loudspeaker asking im guessing for ppl to vote for them or idk.</p>
<p>My bus arrive, i take the bus. I got off the bus, and i walking. Friend determines what lamb barbeque place to visit, so I start walking to the bus stop to get there. Arrive at the bus stop but bus still many tens of minutes to wait before bus arrives. So, I walk to next bus stops.</p>
<p>Walk past some schools, i think high, middle, elementary school, and school for blind which had a bus stop. I stayed at that bus stop for a bit until i decided to continue walking because google map say i will arrive at destination around same time if i just walk instead of waiting for bus.</p>
<p>Continue walking, arrive at destination. It did not open until 5pm so walked to a park, did not enter the park, and walked back to restaurant.</p>
<p>Waited in the queue that had now formed to enter the restaurant until it opened, eventually was sat at a counter booth. We ordered one plate of meat to start even though later i think i saw something on the menu saying to pls order at least two plates of meat to start. I went to bathroom after we ordered , when came back person had done some grill thingy. idk why but they started the grilling process for like two pieces of meat and then never again touched the grill. Also, there were floss picks and ear swabs in the bathroom.</p>

</figure>
<p>Had fun trying the different stuffs on the menu. various parts of lamb, and some lamb sausage ate. “hokkaido ramen salad” ate, kimchi ate. I had a beer which tasted like beer, a “haskap sour” which tasted like not much, esp bc i think i didnt mix it before drinking it. And also had a “lemon sour” which was like 80% ice cube. I believe I also challenged my ordering skills by ordering multiple things at once, in japanese. wow so cool!. Cool experience. Payment was completed in the following manner:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>we was getting up to go</li>
<li>some guy was standing on standby i think knowing we was going</li>
<li>i made eye contact orso with the guy and he said sth like “receipt?” and i affirmed somehow</li>
<li>He gave the receipt. I took the receipt to the payment counter.</li>
<li>The payment counter might have asked me something like if i had a car parking voucher or sth because i think sometimes they ask that. Or maybe they didnt and im mixing up the memory w somewhere else. But i think i didnt understand something and it was probably the car parking thing and they asked in english and i said no or maybe they just assumed no. i dont actually remember what happened so idk why im writing this.</li>
<li>Paid and left</li>
</ol>
<section id="car-parking" class="aside">
<h2>car parking</h2>
<p>in many places in japan i think they will ask you if you have some kind of car-parking somethiong because im guessing they have something to do with that. i dont actually know the japanese dialogue or vocab to deal with this. but i think they do ask u for it i think. in some places and situations. i have probably been confused in all times that i have been asked if i have it.</p>
</section>
<p>After the meal walked friend to bus stop to get to they hotel, and then i went to my hotel which was across the street. This was actually the 2nd hotel i booked for the day. The other hotel was the one i thought was in the other place but was not and actually very far away. This 2nd hotel was actually cheaper i think. The 1st hotel was nonrefundable but i figured it was perhaps simply worth the money not having to spend much time travelling to and from that place. An unfortunate planning. Also the person checked me in asked <ruby>if i spoke japanese<rt>日本語大丈夫ですか</rt></ruby>, in japanese, to which i responded with an ehh-no hand shake. I wonder if this was less “can you speak japanese” and more “can i just speak japanese to you” so im not sure if i should have actually responded e.g. “um a little”, which would probably be easier for them and also an educational experience for me. This was also the first time anyone has ever asked me that question in japan, i think.</p>
<p>The end of day</p>
