<p>Today we will return to tokyo. I wake up and check out and meet friend at the station. We use the ticket machine to buy SHINKANSEN tickets. I never been on a shinkansen that didnt have free-seating so on seat selection i just clicked “put me wherever”. And then friend bought they ticket separately also click put me wherever. That unfortunately meant we got seats far apart in different cars.</p>
<p>We entered the gates and there was a convenience store so i bought a meal box. And warmed it up with the self-serve microwave. Train come and board and wait to arrive at TOKYO.</p>
<p>Ate my meal box it was nice. I looked up if there is trash disposal in shinkansen and internet says there is, at front at back of cars. So i got up and went to one. It was sort of hard to find bc it blends in with wall but I found it and disposed of stuff in it. I then was curious because there was only one receptical like do i put everything including plastic in it? I searched the internet, and from what I think i learned and guessed, actually ur technically supposed to put even PET bottles in there also (the bottle hole next to the trash can was only marked as cans+bottles i think). And someone actually goes through all the trash and sorts it. Which makes sense actually and also explains how someone found friends ticket when He threw it away in Hakodate. And also I recall now/noticed that when u get off shinkansen there are sometimes workers that stand outside w single trash bags to collect trash from ppl getting off as well.</p>

<p>Arrive at TOKYO meet friend inside the gates And then exit the gates. One thing i noticed is that friend still had the shinkansen ticket and i didnt. I thought the gate ate my ticket. That was strange.</p>
<p>But anyway we made our way to the exit of tokyo station i needed to go to take Airport Bus because actually im leave tokyo now.</p>
<p>But then we found exit and then theres another exit gate. Hmm.. Ohh oops, i guess shinkansen exit was not final exit. But I don’t have my ticket anymore..? Oh I guess that’s why friend still had ticket, oopsies. Also, there was some sign in english friend saw that says something like “ur (shinkansen?) ticket DOES come out and if u dont have it go back and ask someone bc you forgot it”.</p>
<p>So we went back to the shinkansen gate and walked up to the person who was watching the ppl coming out making sure they dont forget their ticket or sth or idk collecting the lost tickets it looked like. I showed them my SHINKANSEN TICKET RECEIPT and tried to communicate using the vocabulary i learned from morioka laundry-cleaning person (i.e. 残る) which actually idk is even the correct word, and didnt seem to work and also it was kinda loud so i just like used body motions to try to indicate i forgot to take my ticket when coming out of the gate. They asked sth like which gate u came out? (maybe it was some other question, idk) and i pointed to approximately what i thought gate i came out. And then they thought or observed or idrk what and then they looked at receipt and a ticket they had and then i think they noticed they both came from morioka bc i think they pointed at that and then gave me the ticket, thank you epic!.</p>
<p>So exited tokyo station, friend walk me to the NRT airport bus which was clearly marked. say goodbye. And i rode that bus to NRT and got off at NRT, quite a seamless experience.</p>
<p>I walked around and was confused abt where my airline (Peach) checkin was for a while and walked around in many circles and decided simply ask someone, so showed someone translator phone screen “WHERE IS PEACH DOMESTIC CHECKIN” (but in japanese) and they told me in english where to find it thanks!. so i went there and then used checkin kiosk, but it said i could only check in like umm 90 mins? before flight i think? which was interesting, so i went to go find some food.</p>
<p>I extensively walked around the food area wondering what to eat. There were two Big restaurants, a japanese and chinese one. End up dont go either, i think maybe either full occupancy or intimidating or food didnt appeal, idrk. There was also a TYADUKE place i passed by but it looked kinda intimidating and idrked if i wanted that. I remember hearing like some people saying “lets just get mcdonalds” (but in japanese) and i thought: hmm maybe i should also. so i found the mcdonalds, but looked very busy and full and i decided: hmm actually no. I walked back past the TYADUKE place and it looked like there were foreigners engaging with the restaurant which always makes stuff less intimidating for me, and so i waited in line for the TYADUKE place.</p>
<p>Eventually order, following the precedent of the ppl in front of me. It was a fully interact-with-person process, tell the person what you want (i used the menu to point at) and give the person you payment and then they say to sit wherever and once you did the put like the order slip at ur seat (inside the counter) and then like give u water and then eventually ur food come out they put it over the counter.</p>
<p>I ate my stuff it was nice. The people that was after me was memorable because they sounded to be a korean people that was very good at japanese, or at least very familiar with the process of ordering stuff in japanese and stuff, and they even asked and got the wasabi that the booth had a little sign saying pls ask if u want wasabi i think. i wish i had wasabi.</p>

<p>I finished eating and was slightly unsure of if i needed to return my tray myself but it didnt seem like so so i just stood up and left and i think someone said thx as i leaving so i assume i did not need to return my tray myself.</p>
<p>I went back to the checkin kiosks and touching it but then it has error. It print receipt saying Error pls bring this to counter.</p>
<p>So i went over to the counter and showed the receipt to the person, and then the person doing what seemed like checking me in. They said something i didnt understand so i kind of just tried to act confused and stared at them, and then they said something like “<ruby>name<rt>(お)名前</rt></ruby>” (in japanese) which i understood and i replied something like “James”, and then they clicked around on their i think laptop and looked through some kinds of information sheets. I thought like “ah-ha i acted like i didnt understand japanese and also my name is not japanese so perhaps they have concluded i am not japanese and will give me english literature to see.”</p>
<p>But then they pulled out not english literature but a seat map and started explaining sth to me in japanese. I somehow interpreted that they were probably telling me they have to put me at the emergency-exit seats and ask if im good with that. And so i affirmed, maybe giving a <ruby>Yeah<rt>はい</rt></ruby> in response. And then they showed me what i think was a giant sheet of policies or stuff u potentially have to do in the case of emergency and probably ask me if im ok with all of those. I tried to look at it but its literally all in japanese, and i read like 4 words of a single thing and concluded i have no clue wtf im doing and just said OK. I remember they pointed out or just mentioned also that i cant put any stuff under the seat (i think thats what they said) and i said OK.</p>
<p>Finally they asked me some question which i barely understood but interpreted was “do u have any dangerous items” to which i believe i used my full japanese vocabulary to say: <ruby>ないです<rt>no</rt></ruby>. I don’t actually know if that’s what they asked maybe they asked something like “Do you have any idea what im saying” and that would make sense as well. And finally they give me my boarding pass (a receipt with a QR code on it) and maybe said sth abt go through the security over there (idk what they said).</p>
<p>Given that i didnt understand 95% of the words, i am not sure if the checkin was an educational experience, but it was definitely an experience. I still wonder if the person just was tired and didnt want to try to do any of the procedure in english or they legitamitely thought i was understanding what was going on.</p>
<p>Anyways i went on to the security check. I looked up online briefly and saw that i think japanese domestic flights apparently you can get liquids under 500? 500some? ml through security. and i had the bottle of water i bought yesterday near coin laundry and i didnt want to get rid of it. but it was something like 550ml so just to be safe i drank some of it and then put it in the tray thing with my other stuff (iirc there was a sign saying to put bottle liquids out on the tray(?)).</p>
<p>I went through metal detector and retreived my bag, and also my bottle of water which i saw they also briefly scanned at some idk machine. Went over found gate and waited around until board my flight NRT to FUK.</p>
<p>As expected i was indeed in one of the emergency-exit rows. Someone came over and said sth to me (in japanese) like “Ur in the emergency exit pls um i forget what they say exactly but read the thing in ur front-seat pocket”. luckily that thing in front-seat pocket had english on it and said approx what you would expect from emergency procedure card.</p>
<p>I was the only person in that (half of a) row which was nice i guess, and also slightly more leg room than average. The view out the window was cool for the first few mins but then it was just clouds and/or the sun shined directly off a shiny part of the plane and directly into my eyeballs so i didnt look out the window very much.</p>

<p>Used the bathroom once and shortly arrived at FUK. I followed directions to the TRAIN and then found and rode the TRAIN. I remember on the TRAIN i saw some ppl wearing sandals and also shorts which i had not seen people wearing in the past many days.</p>
<p>Got off at HAKATA station and went to check in at the APA hotel i was staying. i check in and think what to eat. I look at google maps and there are some places but all open at 5 or 5:30, i think it is 4:something i just want to eat and go to sleep. The Dominoes ad on the desk look pretty tasty and i have not had japanese pizza. But you have to phone-order and idk if i have the means mentally or physically to do that. On google maps, one place look good but on one of the google review mention u have to take off ur shoes or sth and sit on the floor and i had sandals, and dont wearing socks at the time, so i predicted that would be kind of awkward, and also restaurants that are more “traditionally(?)” japanese kind of scare me bc im afraid im gonna have no clue what to do there.</p>
<p>I decide simply go to a classic close by, a Matsuya+Mycurry.</p>
<p>I walk over there. i think the ordering machine was on the outside..? or maybe i am confusing with other matsuya i went to. Order/enter store. Sit at a seat. The atmosphere is quite depressing. There is maybe one or two groups chatting, maybe. Occasionally with the Bing Bong number blah blah blah pls come to counter announcement, and the worker says some stuff, nobody say anything in response. Just get they food go eat it, put they tray back, leave. An older guy come in, seats at seat next to mine. As usual i dont make no eye contact or nothing with them but it feels more depressing than usual. I got my food when it pin-pons and eat it. A tonkatsu and curry, taste is good. This is my second time at MyCurry and the tonkatsu continued to impress, feels so fresh and plump and crispy and delicious. Yet the atmosphere still is depressing.</p>

<img src="media/20241022_165257.webp" alt="" /><figcaption>both of the times i have visited a mycurry syokudou i have tried the tonkatu and curry and both times it has been exceptional. however both times it was depressing for one reason or another, which is sad</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I finish and put my tray back, i thinking to try to say something when do so to break depressing feeling, but i do not. Worker calls the routine Thx and i say nothing in response and leave the store.</p>
<p>I go back to hotel and wash/brushteeth/sleep. I also use phone think of what to do tomorrow. I also watched very engaged this random television program that came up on the TV about people playing crane arcade game.</p>
