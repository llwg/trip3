<p>I woke up today in TSUKUBA in my hotel and i checked out of the hotel. The reason I am in tukuba is that I am going to walk up the nearby tukuba mountain. They have a bus to tukuba mountain at tukuba station so I walk over to tukuba station. The bus run every hour i think and I have a little time before it arrive so I hope to eat breakfast and also buy some food at convenience store to eat in the middle of my walk up tukuba mountain.</p>
<section id="why-walk-up-tsukuba-mountain" class="aside">
<h2>Why walk up tsukuba mountain?</h2>
<p>After walking across some rocks in japan this trip, i remembered/realised that i think i quite like walking across/up things like “hiking”. for example when i walk up mountains in kyoto that was still very memorable. and also when i walked 19km along some roads at night in korea that was also quite memorable. so i think: hey lets walk up more mountain. and yesterday in the train from narita to ueno i looked up “hiking around tokyo” or sth and read random lists and Mount Tsukuba seemed like a reasonable doable walk so i decide to come here now.</p>
</section>
<p>At the station idrk what to eat for breakfast. I saw some place with a poster for a sausage bread that looked pretty enticing (mister donut). So I go in. And then i was intimidated because you had to talk to person and i didnt really understand how the set meal worked. I thinking about walking out. I turn walk towards exit. But I see someone that dont look ethnically Japanese and they look like they are happily enjoying they breakfast. Idk they background but anyways i think it inspired me to simply go and order and eat the food, so I waited in line.</p>
<p>I actually don’t remember how the ordering went except at the end i got kinda confused and also the worker said to pls pay on the like customer-facing tablet thingy where you could select the payment method. for some reason i didnt see credit maybe it really wasnt there so i selected the transportation IC card but i couldnt get my card in the back of my phone case to scan, idk what was up so i just took it out of back of case and scanned it like that and it worked while worker was getting drink.</p>
<p>I take my tray which contained drink and i think little number tent thing to a free table. I believe some time later someone came out with my SausageBread and took the number tent i think. And so I am all ready to eat.</p>
<p>The Sausage bread called “Cheese Dog” (but in japanese) was a Weiner disproportionally long in comparison to the bread it sat in. It had cheese and i think marinara sauce on it. Japanese Weiners taste different. like the skin is especially prominent and the filling feels more.. processed? soft? idrk. idk but i liked the weiner+marinara sauce+cheese combo very tasty. I wish it had more bread and marinara sauce though. My drink was Melon Soda.</p>

<p>I finished eating and put my stuff in tray return and left. It was now almost time for bus and i dont think i saw any convenient convenience store or something or i was afraid to miss bus so i just went to find bus, skip buy food for walk and hope they had a convenience store at mountain or a food place or idk.</p>
<p>I found the bus and boarded the bus. The vibe of bus was quite bustling. I ride the bus got off the last stop.</p>
<p>I go to walk up the mountain. There seem to be large field-trip going on, there is a lot of elementary(?) young student group walking up the mountain with their teachers/chaperones.</p>
<p>Some spots i could simply walk on the side on the um like less-convenient side of the trail, like on some grass instead of the stairs that was there. But other spots it was kinda awkward and i just sort of stood there and shuffled along with the group of young people. However it was kind of fun like i was also taking a school trip with them. But at some point there was a long stretch of side-path that i could go up so i walked up that passed the first group of students. some time(s) i got a KONNICHIWA or GANBATTE(KUDASAI) (idk bc i dont speak japanese) from the group of young people which was fun and also slightly overwhelming because i didnt know that would happen and i sort of smiled and waved.</p>
<p>After passing the first group of young students i walked approximately behind some group of young adults who later seemed to be maybe a group of international students, idrked but interesting.</p>
<p>The group of young adult students (and i, shortly behind them) walked on and eventually encountered another big group of young(er) small students, where we sort of just walked behind them and follow along.</p>
<p>At some point a pair of young adults came along from behind and eventually decided to try to pass the big group of small young students, so i followed behind them passing by the young students because it is less awkward when you are just following behind someone.</p>

<p>After um various passings and stuff and walking up stuff i finally reached: The “female” peak of MOUNT TSUKUBA (there are two peaks). There were some rocks you can sit on and i sat on one and observed the view. The view was good. i did not really view it too much or take pictures or anything though bc there were quite a number of other people there also so i left after a short while.</p>

<section id="bizzare-shaped-rocks" class="aside">
<h2>bizzare-shaped rocks</h2>
<p>Also advertised on TSUKUBA MOUNTAIN is they have some “bizarre-shaped rocks” or something. I passed by several and idk they didnt really look too bizzare to me though i didnt really stop to have a good look bc i was walking and also there was a bit of traffic i just keep going.</p>
</section>
<p>After visiting the “female” peak i go walk in the direction of the other peak. In the middle of the two peaks they have this rest area or something where they have food shops and stuff. Very cool. I was hungry, and it was lunch time. But the vibes was off. There was not a customer in there except maybe like this group of ppl idk was customers or who. And I didn’t see any english signage so idk if it was friendly towards tourists. So I am scared and simply dont try to eat. Even though i thought of getting curry udon. And I was hungry.</p>
<p>I am pretty sure there was a vending machine though and idk why i didnt at least get a drink because the water i had only had like one sip left. Not great plan.</p>
<p>Anyways I walked on to the second peak, the “male” peak. I arrived there and it was very underwhelming. The view was not that great there was just some kinda shrine maybe on it i didnt really take a good look bc again there were ppl around. But i did eat a citrus fruit and grape gummies i was carrying, and some water.</p>
<section id="passing-people-on-japanese-mountain" class="aside">
<h2>passing people on japanese mountain</h2>
<p>Often I passed by people on mountain. Sometimes the people going opposite way, or the same way.</p>
<p>Same way feels awkward like i would rather not pass them just wait for them and then go, but like one time i was like sorta standing behind these older folk climbing up trying to not assert any presence but then someone said oh oops sorry! go ahead (i think) (but in japanese). uh so i went ahead. Maybe try to mumble a KONNITIHA while passing and such. Idk what the Trail etiquette is, in any culture actually.</p>
<p>Opposite way was slightly less awkward because the contact time is less. I soon learned that people will sometimes say KONNICHIWA to each other when passing. I soon learned to do this myself in order to appear like a normal human being. Also i think this is the second only times in my life i heard people saying KONNICHIWA irl. The first time i heard it was someone said KONNICHIWA to me when passing by as i was walking down a mountain in KYOTO. This was a suprisingly good Speaking Exercise because i had to keep repeating the same phrase and it slowly went from a slight inaudible mumble to a Full mumble.</p>
</section>
<p>Walking down from the male peak, I wanted to go to some lake that was labelled on trail map. i think that i sort of knew what path i was walking on, but not if i was walking in the correct direction because the directions wasnt actually labelled on the trail sign. At some point i reached a fork and didnt know which way to go so i walked one day, but realised it was just looping backwards because i could begin to hear the busy rest-stop area so i turned around, retraced to the fork, and took the other path.</p>
<p>I eventually reached an area which was clearly marked with the path and direction i wanted to go, so i simply walked into it.</p>
<p>At this time i had been walking for like three hours and tbh i was hungry and also legs/feet beginning to kinda feel idk. according to the trail map it would only take ~80 mins to get to some temple, and ~25 mins to reach the lake. ok cool! I walk.</p>
<p>The trail was almost all downhill from there i believe. Some stairs, some not stairs. Not many people, only pass by a handful of people going the opposite way. Kinda tiring. Once I sat down and ate i believe my last Citrus fruit i had. I have heard it is not good to eat citrus on empty stomach but idrced because i was hungry.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Eventually i reached um.. not really the temple, but a car road.. that led to the temple or something.</p>
<p>I looked at the temple, did not seem to have many points of interest for me (i.e. food or water). There was some people sitting in a building i think, idk what they was doing over there.</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/20241025_135741.webp" alt="" /><figcaption>some structure at the temple</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I left and walked over to lake, which was done by walking along some car roads and paths through mountain. and also this very poorly-kept pedestrian(?) pathway, very overgrown, had to crawl under some stuff, ran into many spiderwebs.</p>
<p>Eventually arrived at the lake. Which was very unimpressive. I looked it up and apparently it is manmade. it did look manmade. it looked more like water reservoir than lake. and also had a bunch of fences and signs saying dont go in. so i didnt go in.</p>
<p>I exited the area walking to bus stop as instructed by google maps. I reached the big car road, and across the big car road were many fields. cool. I walk along the big car road to the bus stop. The bus stop is located like in front of some unbuilt house foundations and labelled “Remains of Sakayori Station” interesting. I just sit there wait for bus.</p>

</figure>
<p>Bus arrives pulls up i get on. Bus driver says something like “u get off here right?” and i notice there is small person student who i guess has not yet learned to press the button to make bus stop at ur stop and then they get out of they seat and get off bus where i see they greeted by i assume they mother.</p>
<p>I sit on the bus only person. They drive to Mount Tsukuba. I get off. There is vending machine. I buy pocari sweat drink some. I walk to other bus stop to get back to Tsukuba Station. I wait. Bus come. I ride bus. I arrive Tsukuba station. I get off. I am at tsukuba station.</p>
<p>On the bus over i looked up what food i could eat at tsukuba station. I already uh agreed to meet friend in Tokyo eat dinner but i am hungry i just want to eat something light at least now because get to central tokyo take more than an hour. I see on google maps there is a food court with some foods i can eat. I go there.</p>
<p>I go to the food court i just go to the restaurant i saw on google maps that looked enticing, Ringer Hut. Apparently a chain restaurant serve CHANPON and stuff.</p>
<p>I go there i already basically know what gonna order. But i look at the menu posted big at the top to confirm what i wanna order exists. Ok. I go up to the person. I say um SMALL CHANPON (it’s literally named SMALL CHANPON) and SET GYOZA (please). or something like that. from my studying of menu beforehand i thought knew that the Gyoza u get as set come in 5 or 3 but the big menu posted above just listed “set gyoza” and had a picture of five so like maybe that was the default idk? i just said SET GYOZA. And the person said something and pointed at the menu on counter and im pretty sure said “Theres five or three (which do you want)” sth like that (idk japanese) and i said <ruby>three<rt>SANKO DE</rt></ruby>. i knew how to say three. because i learned it earlier. in case i need to say that. in case i order it. And they understood it and processed my order and gave me buzzer.</p>
<p>I sit at a food court table with my buzzer wait for food, buzzer buzz I picked up food. They said something to me that idked. i think it might have been “get ur own chopsticks bro” (i got my own chopsticks). I sat down. My first CHANPON it was good i ate it all, bus my tray, leave.</p>

</figure>
<p>Enter the Tsukuba Express downstairs take it to tokyo, i think its terminal in akihabara. and transfer to some other trains.</p>
<p>Friend agree to meet go to a SAIZERIYA in Ginza so i and friend arrived there. There was quite a wait outside. All the waiting stools was occupied and ppl standing around waiting to be called in. Friend say do you just wanna wait and i said ok and so i put 2Adults under my name on the waitlist, which i wrote as “James” and then “ジェームス” underneath. And we wait.</p>
<p>The waitlist seemed to move pretty fast. There seemed to be quite a diversity of people in the Ginza Saizeriya waitlist. Parties of one, Parties of multiple, look-like-ethnically-Japanese, look-like-not-ethnically-Japanese. A healthy mix of everyone, all united by Going To Eat Saizeriya.</p>
<p>Eventually the person called my name and we entered and was seated. We did not really know how to order, there was like some order sheets of paper and a pen at the table was we supposed to fill that out? There was also a bell?. dunno. So we decided what we was gonna get and then press bell. And then person came over and told us to write our order on the paper pls. So we did, it was you just write the menu numbers on the paper and quantity of each. Then press bell, hand them paper. Then they read it and punch it into their little device and then read the order to you to confirm what u ordered. But the restaurant was so loud and the order was in japanese so it was quite hard to hear what was being said so im pretty sure we confirmed without hearing the majority of what was said. When we first ordered i was sort of worried because i wrote my 1s sort of like 2s and we werent sure if the person said that we ordered 2 of everything or 1.</p>
<p>Luckily it was just 1 of everything, our food began arriving. First the wine arrived. It was some special kind of certified wine of some variety that friend knew about. The wine glasses was plastic. Then food came.</p>
<p>I enjoyed some uh clam pasta and lamb. Then i ordered umm i think hamburg steak and pizza and beer. Friend took half of everything we split it. And then i ordered escargot, some kind of doria, and friend a little mini pitcher of white wine. friend took like two escargot i think and half of the mini pitcher and i ate other.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>The food was very good. And the restaurant vibe and experience was very good as well. It felt very fun. Like who would have thought i would one day be sipping italian wine out of a plastic wine glass in Ginza after walking up and down a mountain. Like i literally still had dried mud on i think my right big toe (i wasnt wearing socks). I had been in Japan for Two Weeks but i think tonight was the night i felt The Most “inside” Japan. like i was fully present while enjoying the experience.</p>
<p>After finishing eating, pay at the self-register and leave. Use the bathroom and then go to train station. Friend say can you escort me to my hotel i say OK. But then i say/think: oh i want to pick up my glasses (in shibuya) today so dont have to return to the area. And then we on a train that goes straight to shibuya so friend say oh ok just go there ill get off at my stop. So him did that thx friend and i got off at shibuya and rushed over to glasses shop it was getting very close to closing time.</p>
<p>I successfully navigated there in time. I started really having to utilize the bathroom but its closing time so i go to glasses. Go to second floor fish in backpack take out my QR code receipt scan it take glasses from locker close locker put on glasses woah cool! Leave store. Wow i need to utilize bathroom.</p>
<p>Walking in the streets. towards station approx. Wow i see a big store, seems have bathroom. Go in there. use bathroom nice.</p>
<p>Walk back to Shibuya station. Take trains to. Yokohama. Arrive at my hotel for the night. A Big APA hotel. there was some trouble checking in because i think because i didnt have my middle names in the reservation but passport has middle names or sth idrk. Arrive at room. Wash. Sleep.</p>
