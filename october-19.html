<p>Today i got up and took my laundry and walked to a coin laundry. There were some closer coin laundries but the one i chose looked better based on google reviews and photos. I walked along some sort of harbor area.</p>

</figure>
<p>I arrived and started wash cycle, about 30 mins. the coin laundry was bright and modern and had some coca-cola themed retro decor. I exited coin laundry whil laundry was going and wandered towards the shore-area, but there was large road with no crosswalk so i just turned back and waited in laundry place a few mins for wash cycle to complete, wondering what to eat.</p>
<p>Wash cycle finish, I put clothes in a drier. I then walked across the parking lot to the convenience store that had a big sign outside i think say they selling donuts.</p>
<p>I choose a vitamin-d drink and rice ball. I tried to look sort of at the hot-container thing where i supposed the donuts would be stored. however it was sort of very awkward to stand there looking at it, and its right next to the checkout. so i dont really see what was there and just check out. The worker that check me out asked me a question that i didnt understand but i think it was if i wanted anything from the hot-container bc ig they saw me staring at it and i anti-affirmed. oh well.</p>
<p>Friend announced to me that they will come to where im at to do laundry because they hotel coin laundry is occupied. so i waited there, take my stuff out from drier (which majority was dry after 18 mins. i left some stuff in and add another 9 mins. very effective drier wow!) and fold n put in bag.</p>
<p>I waiting a little longer for my remaining laundry dry, sitting there, there was another person sitting there waiting for drier or so i think. There was a mother and some children i think, and other characters, it was quite busy now, actually. Stuff dry, i take it out put it in bag, leave the store.</p>
<p>I walk around randomly outside store wait friend arrive because i think they asked if i could show them how to use it and i said its same as hotel one but um yeah i waited anyways. And friend finally arrived. However by the time they arrive some ppl had used both of the like 2 washers so friend waiting for it. and now it start raining.</p>
<section id="more-driers-than-washers" class="aside">
<h2>more driers than washers</h2>
<p>it seems like there are more driers than washers in the japanese coin laundries ive been to. i think ive heard that many japanese ppl have washer but no drier. so maybe they go to coin laundry to dry some stuff if they not air-drying it, that would make sense. i think i saw some people come up with bag of laundry and put it in just drier. However im not japanese so idk the truth of these suppositions.</p>
</section>
<p>I walked back to my hotel in some pretty heavy rain. Google maps said take bus arrive around same time so i just walk. my socks became soggy very quickly.</p>

<p>Arrive at hotel and take a nice foot bath and shower and also washed my socks in the sink and dried them. and checked out of hotel.</p>
<p>Meet friend at Aomori station and we went to a small restaurant with line outside. It seems like they have a lot of “Hotate”. I got a fish-sashimi meal and hotate-fry. And a beer. Overall, it was yummy, and the vibes were comfy. There was some like im guessing some fellow tourists and/or also ppl speaking english at the table behind us and at some point i think some guy at the self-serve water station told the lady sth like Sumimasen Cappu Wa to let them know the cups were run out or sth. The restaurant was busy.</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/20241019_120414.webp" alt="" /><figcaption>here was the hotate fry</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Finished meal. I think i used one of my 2000-yen bills again while paying but honestly idk bc literally nowhere i used them at noticed or cared about them. Exited and then walked around a bit. Saw sth like an international day-care(?) that had a “no photography” sign posted on the window, and also a railroad festival, which was like some tents set up outside with ppl having railroad-related booths of interest.</p>
<p>Friend wanted to eat apple pies bc apparently the region does apples. Thus went to one cafe, shared one apple pie. Then walked to another place, like large indoor marketlike place. Bought three apple pies, found some place inside to sit, shared the three apple pies. They were nice i guess.</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/20241019_125201.webp" alt="" /><figcaption>the first cafe we went to. i ate half of that pie. friend ate half of it and that coffee.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We walked back to station, the railroad festival had some kind of music display which was cool. In the station we looked at the AOIMORI-RAILROAD FARE MAP to get to HACHINOHE. HACHINOHE was listed at some price on the map, but looking at the ticket vending machine it did not dispense tickets of that value. which was slightly confusing. And then i noticed there was huge banner in japanese saying sth like “Get a one-day pass if ur going to HACHINOHE”. I guessed this was not just friendly advice but also literally telling you to do that. So we bought one-day passes, which was cheaper than the fare for HACHINOHE listed on the fare map.</p>
<p>So we took the AOIMORI RAILROAD over to HACHINOHE. it was not very packed on the train but it was still the case that some ppl was standing to not sit next to a stranger.</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/20241019_142321.webp" alt="" /><figcaption>cute blue train. it has the aoimori railway character on the front.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Ride the train. One train person occasionally passed through the (two) train cars selling what looked to be character goods. AOIMORI RAILROAD character goods. tbh i kinda wanted to have a look but i did not attempt to interact. i did look online though and they were cute but i probably still would not buy them even if i did not have to interact with the person to buy them.</p>
<p>Uh i think we arrived at HACHINOHE STATION. and then i think we went to 本HACHINOHE station. and then walk around. It was quite cold. especially bc i was still wearing shorts, and no socks. i think because of rain earlier in the day i didnt want wet pants/socks. And also it was way warmer earlier in day.</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/20241019_164853.webp" alt="" /><figcaption>this was a nice see-saw that friend did not ride with me</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>And then i think friend left and went to check into they hotel i think?. And we met in town, in an arcade where i went into to use the bathroom.</p>
<p>Then wondered where to eat dinner. Think to eat Chinese food. So followed friend to some small Chinese restaurant place. After shortly maybe theorizing what we would order, we opened the door where we was greeted by i believe an empty restaurant except im guessing the restaurant owner person, and a lady who maybe was they wife idk who was sitting at the counter. The restaurant owner dude said sth that we did not understand and did not give hospitable vibes so we closed the door and left.</p>
<p>Not sure what was up with that but anyways i followed friend to a different chinese restaurant they found. We entered the restaurant and was seated, in an area with a sliding door. There was literally no other customers in the restaurant i think.</p>

<p>Anyways had some food and left. it was cold outside. i walked back to 本HACHINOHE station and took train back to HACHINOHE station where i was staying and washed and went to sleep probably.</p>
<section id="did-i-drink-at-that-restaurant-too" class="aside">
<h2>did i drink at that restaurant too?</h2>
<p>i dont remember if it was here but i remember somewhere else besides the sushi place they explicitly asked us what drinks we wanted. actually maybe it was multiple places, i dont really remember. maybe it was the hotate place we ate at in the afternoon.</p>
<p>when they ask i assume ur supposed to order one. but actually idrk if ur supposed to or not. im not japanese. but im guessing that its probably more polite to since drinks probably more profitable. so i remember a few times i dont really plan on drinking anything but then they ask so i order beer. idk if that was this restaurant though. maybe i should learn to order something other than beer.</p>
