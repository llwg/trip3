<p>My flight was direct from IAD to HND. It was around noon, thus I ate breakfast in my house and my father dropped me off at the airport (thank you), and I rode the airplane.</p>

<h2>this airport security</h2>
<p>it was probably first time in united states i been to that they didnt using the um big cylndrical scanning machines that are scary. they just had a rectangular metal detector that you walk through i believe.</p>
</section>
<p>The flight was nice, I guess. The food was nice, top-tier airplane food I have had. They gave ice-cream after one of the meals even, wow!.</p>
<p>The whole flight I did not recline my seat because I once heard something that it is rude to recline ur shinkansen seat (which has like 2x size of the airplane seat) without first asking the person behind you. And this was on Japanese Airline and the person behind me looked Japanese so I simply did not recline it, because i did not want to ask, and also since any way sitting in the airplane seats feels terrible in any way so I figured it would be equally worth my time trying to sit straight upright with an erect spine.</p>

<h2>aside: anti-lumbar-support</h2>
<p>why does it feel like airplane and a lot of other seats have anti-spine-support, i.e. if you fully press ur back against them ur spine will be curved in a really weird unnatural position. idk perhaps my imagination.</p>
</section>
<p>In the airplane I did things like try to sleep, and watching movie on the in-flight entertainment thing.</p>
<p>I watched two Japanese movies in a last-minute effort to Japaneselanguagemaxx before entering the country.</p>
<p>The first one I watched was very healing. It was great in that it started with saddest part and then the rest of the movie was simply healing from the sad moment. it was great and I felt healed.</p>
<p>The second one was kinda the opposite like it was kinda nice and cute in the beginning and then got spooky and disturbing at the end, so any healing that I had with the first movie was undone.</p>
<p>I also slept some, I do not remember how much. I used the technique of covering-eyes-with-mouth-mask. I also tried to sleep sitting upright (i.e. with back away from the chair which weirdly bent my spine if I sat into it). I am not sure if these techniques helped me sleep much, but I did do them.</p>
