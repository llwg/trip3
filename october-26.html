<p>Today i woke up in my room and then i checked out and taking train over to HEIWAJIMA which was the designated meeting spot to meet friend. I stopped by some convenience store with a self register and bought a fruit-gummy vitamin drink thing. I ate it on the train.</p>
<p>I think i contracted a sort of depression that morning. idrk why. perhaps it was aftereffects of drank alcohol yesterday or didnt get enough sleep. Perhaps it was because i think i saw another depressing train delay message i think “person on tracks”, i always feel depression and deep sad scary feeling inside when i see those kinds of messages, “personal incident” and the like because im guessing its um. not too accidental on the person’s part but maybe it is idk i dont really want to know. Or maybe it is because friend kept sending messages about how depressing the HEIWAJIMA area was so it caused me to be depressing as well. im not really sure.</p>
<p>I reach the area walk over to the JONATHAN’S we agree to meet at. It was in some shopping center thing that looks like part of the backrooms sort of. We go into the Jonathan’s and seated and ordering on the tablet. Order for a while i dont decide very quickly. At some point friend remarked upon the sodium content which was presented on the menu, high. I for first time realized that Japanese Restaurant Food often must be pretty salty like with just one dish your entire recommended daily sodium intake. And I usually order eat multiple dishes. So that was sort of depressing also. Eventually order stuff.</p>

<p>The food was OK. it tasted unusually salty and unhealthy even though i probably ate the same amount of sodium yesterday dinner. We pay at self register leave.</p>
<p>Friend walking to park i follow him. Taking some pictures at the park. Eventually leave the park. Saw a young people baseball playing. Walk to monorail station. Friend say goodbye. Goodbye. We enter gates together. I decide just follow friend to airport idk what else to do. So go there. See friend off to security. Leave airport and take KEIKYU up to tokyo, the same route took on first night. On the train ride i looking at hotels in tokyo. It is Tokyo, and also Weekend, so prices are kinda high. All above 100USD. But then i just happen to scroll past some place that is in Central Tokyo Area i think and also under 100USD which was great thx. I placed reservation.</p>

<p>I take train over to the area and walk over to a coin laundry in the area. Walking along i was reminded that it was almost halloween because there was a little halloween event orso going on, children dressed in costume and walking with they parents. I arrive laundry, put clothes into washer, leave and walk over to hotel to check in.</p>
<p>I check in hotel visit room. Go back out walk back to laundry. It actually has some minutes left. I go out and walk around a little but i think i am tired and not much seeing so go back just sit in laundry. Laundry finish, put in a drier and then Sit There using phone, think what to do tonight. Tonight i plan to go out and buy Makeup Cosmetics because sister requested me to do so i must. So maybe i also buy stuff for myself, like socks (i lost my other pair in noda). And maybe a duvet/blanket/comforter thing. And then what else do i do tonight?. I remember Shibuya i think was known for having halloween festivities or sth but when i looked it up it appeared that they literally simply cancelled halloween like say No Halloween Bro. No Events. No Drinking On Streets. I actually remembered i saw a sign saying no drinking on streets yesterday when i was picking up glasses.</p>
<p>So yeah uh idk i folded laundry when its done drying and walked back to hotel. I took a shower and then took train over to – Ginza, because i read the <ruby>Muji<rt>無印良品</rt></ruby> flagship store is There. I went to that store. I looked and indecisioned about buying a blanket stuffs and eventually just bought. They did not have socks i wanted. I left, and then went to Harajuku because Cosmetic store is there. But i saw uniqlo also and i went in and bought pants and left and went into cosmetic store. I then spent a long time searching for every item that sister gave me on list.</p>
<p>At first I was very confused no clue how any of the organization worked. At some point i asked a worker if they have some specific product and they said sth like oh yeah its on the 2nd floor so i go up there idk what im looking for. Then i saw they have a digital store directory thingy you can select what brand you looking for and it show you where it is located in the store. So i tried to do that except i expected the brand to like be the big brand they put at the top of each shelf so i didnt see the brand i was looking for on the big sign so i asked someone where something is and they guided me over like 2 feet over and pointed it out on the shelf oh oops thx.</p>
<p>And then it was just process of continually squeeze way through many people to the digital directory thing, find brand, try to find it, etc. and whatever. I probably should have bought blanket and pants afterwards because my arms was tired from holding it.</p>
<p>Eventually collected what was found and go check out and it was finally done. I leave. I put all my stuff in a coin locker in some station nearby and then walk out of station. Also at this point my legs started hurting like not just in a wow sore! but like in an actual you-should-probably-stop-and-go-rest-or-risk-being-injured-if-you-are-not-already-injured kind of way.</p>
<p>I kinda had to go to the bathroom so i went into an IKEA because i thought they would have a bathroom. But then they had sign saying sth like um Customers Only pls go use the other bathroom elsewhere or idrked. I think ppl walking behind me also entered the ikea to go to the bathroom lol.</p>
<p>So I went around search for the specified bathroom. I eventually saw some signs and went up some stuff and followed people who was, i believe, also searching for the bathroom. and we was directed by some person say: the bathroom is over there. so i used the bathroom.</p>
<p>Then I walked on. I wonder what to eat for dinner. I encountered some street. Some people in costumes and motorcycles drove thru. I saw a mcdonalds so i went in there and ordered a foods. And i stopped by a convenience store and bought some alcohols. I then took food and walked over to YOYOGI PARK. It was dark. There was someone busking at the entrance. I found a bench and sat down. Sounded like some gathering of young adults nearby associating in English, so sat there in the dark eating my food with some familiar sounds in the background.</p>
<p>I got a “Bai Big Mac” which i think is just a big mac but with double the meat, interesting. And fries and drink. And also some sort of sweet pie pastry. My alcohols was uh honestly i dont remember i think one was a tangerine sour of some sort.</p>

<p>There was also some sounds of people performing music in the distance. I finished my food and leave. I stop by the trash can dumpster area which was quite full, i threw stuff in there probably sorting generally correctly, i think. Leave the park.</p>
<p>I decide to walk down to Shibuya to see what was going on over there. There was a gathering of neat-looking cars. But there was not many people. Like it was the most empty i have ever seen it in all the times i have been there.</p>
<p>I take a train i think one stop up back to harajuku. I fetch my belongings and take train back to hotel. I really needed to use bathroom. I made it back to hotel. And uh washed/went to sleep probably.</p>
