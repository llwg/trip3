<p>There was not much that happened on the planes back so i wont write much about it. Here are some points</p>
<ul>
<li>They had “Two-hearted IPA” on the plane which i drank. again oops.</li>
<li>I watched two movies on the entertainment system thing</li>
<li>I probably took a nap</li>
<li>the plastic trays they serve the food on kept sliding around on the table.</li>
<li>idk why but like 5 people in close proximity of me kept coughing. none of them was wearing masks pretty sure. a few of them were coughing violently like i saw one person literally heaving their entire body as they cough. lol.</li>
<li>I re-checked my cardboard box at the layover</li>
<li>I stood in super long lines at the layover getting through U.S. border patrol or whatever. also the customs(?) process was kinda really uncomfortable and felt really judgemental, or maybe it was just that the officers really hated their jobs or sth idk</li>
</ul>
<p>the end</p>
