<p>I woke up this day some time 4 or 5 again. Friend was still sleeping so I went out for a morning walk.</p>
<p>It was quite very cold, especially because i was wearing shorts</p>
<section id="did-people-gossip-about-me" class="aside">
<h2>did people gossip about me</h2>
<p>In SAPPORO it was quite chilly and everyone was wearing long clothes, and especially black outerwear. In contrast, I was wearing shorts (i was planning on buying pants later), a blue shirt, and some goofy-looking sandals (with socks).</p>
<p>I think it was yesterday that we was walking along on the street and we was stopped at a pedestrian crossing and i heard some ppl behind me talking, and i think i picked up some key phrases e.g. “sandals” that indicated that they were gossiping about me. However i dont actually know if they was bc i dont know japanese. Thus i had anxiety.</p>
<p>if i could have understood what they was saying fully i think i would have been less anxiety, but it was the scary intermediate zone of “think potentially gossip but maybe not but probably so”</p>
<p>either way, it remained in my memory</p>
</section>
<p>I walked around a bit in the streets. it was pretty quiet</p>
<p><img src="media/20241015_060625.webp" alt="a street" /> <img src="media/20241015_060306.webp" alt="sapporo" /></p>
<p>Outside of some parking lot there was a “halloween macaron” vending machine vending halloween macarons. It looked funny so I got the mint-chocolate one for friend as late birthday present. I think we mentioned potentially going to SAPPORO pastry shop or so for bday but we never did, so I guess this was next best thing.</p>
<p>I walked more, and eventually friend woke up and indicated was ready to do stuff. So I took a train one stop back to SAPPORO STATION and met them, and we walked over to a sandwich shop SANDRIA which i think is famous friend said. (side note: I think they had a sandwich vending machine at sapporo station, which had a queue of people waiting to use it) On our way saw various things, e.g. crows flocking around a garbage truck collecting garbage.</p>
<p>We stood outside for a while staring at the menu posted in both Japanese and English and decided order. I gave friend cash (i think it was cash-only) and we walked in and friend ordered at the counter, which was told them “(Menu name) One” for each menu name wanted i believe.</p>
<p>They took out the sandwiches requested and took payment and gave sands to us in a bag i think and we left, after first looking at the hot-coffee(?) vending machine which looked to be out-of-service.</p>
<p>In order to get drinks, we went to the SEICOMART across the street, and they had a hotbox (hot refrigerator?) of warm drinks, thus i got tea and i think friend got coffee and we payed for those and left.</p>
<section id="what-happened-at-the-seicomart-checkout" class="aside">
<h2>what happened at the seicomart checkout?</h2>
<p>It feels like every non-self checkout ive performed in japan (and many ive done in not japan) has been imprinted in my memory. However tbh i do not particularly remember this seicomart checkout. Perhaps probably because it was not performed by myself, and mostly done by friend actually</p>
<p>I think the worker might have asked something like do you have a point card to which i body-language-Anti-Affirmed or so. But im not sure if that actually happened or what happened. Also that might have actually been the seicomart on day 18.</p>
<p>I also think they gave us a bag, and idk if there was any related dialogue for that. Or actually we didnt get a bag. i forget. maybe we didnt.</p>
<p>all i really remember is friend saying “suica” to indicate that they wished to pay with suica (on their phone), i think.</p>
</section>
<p>We walked with our food to a PARK to eat it. On our way there was a Kimchi Vending Machine which was cool and funny.</p>
<p>We arrived in the PARK and ate our food on a bench. The food was very good. I especially liked the potato-salad bacon sandwich because i like potato salad. The tea was still warm which was nice.</p>
<p>I played on the slides a bit. I slid down a slide which actually had water on it and my pants became very wet. I also hit my head climbing into one of the slides quite hard, like i could feel my teeth clacking together bc of it. And i swung on a swing.</p>
<p>Eventually left, took train back and walk to hotel.</p>
<p>Now it was DO FIRST LAUNDRY. There was coin laundry in hotel it sayed. So it go there with our laundry. I only had one pair of lower-body-clothes (shorts) thus i wore that um robe they usually provide in hotels, and the room slippers. down to the coin laundry. However it was soon discovered that i dont have enough 100-yen coins to actually perform laundry for both people. Thus it do the following plan: to go downstairs to lobby and ask shop or front counter to exchange a 1000-yen bill to 100-coin. Here is what happened:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>elevator down to front</li>
<li>i walked up to front and said sth like “(kore) <ruby>HYAKUEN COIN DE<rt>百円コインで</rt></ruby>..”, and they successfully understood (on the first try!), and gave me 100 yen coins thank you wow!</li>
<li>go back up and did laundry.</li>
</ol>
<p>i noticed later that actually in a sign at room it said to pls dont wear room slippers or gown outside of room. oops!.</p>
<p>The laundry driers was very underpowered. But also i think it recommended like 60 mins drying for the stuff we was drying but i only did 30 mins. Friends stuff (more volume) still unsatisfactory dry, so dry for longer. However we both decided to air-dry some stuff. Unfortunately nothing really air-dried in like 30 mins to an hour. We tried use the room’s hair dryer to dry some stuff and i guess it worked a little, but not a lot.</p>
<p>Eventually when laundry all sorted out, check out hotel. Walked to train station to put a things in a coin locker. Then walked to HOKKAIDO UNIVERSITY campus to look around.</p>
<p>First, stopped in university goods store, where friend purchased some souvenier clothing. Then, walked around the campus. Funnily, there seemed to be a lot of fellow tourists. Took some photos and stuff.</p>
<p>Eventually came across a cafeteria. The cafeteria on a sign say that cannot serve non-school people within some hours, and we was within those hours. Continued on.</p>
<p>Found some engineering building i think, and inside they had another cafeteria. Wondered if could eat there. but left.</p>
<p>But when leaving saw someone speaking english looked like may be international student, friend asked me if should ask that person whether possible to eat at that engineering building cafeteria. I said yes. Friend asked person. Person said that maybe or maybe not. But northern-er cafteria probably everyone can eat, do not check student id, etc. Thanks for the information! Thus, went north.</p>
<p>Arrived northern cafeteria. It was quite intimdating bc first time in such an environment. They had menu posted. And some arrows on the floor directing ppl into lines based on what kind of food u wanted. Idked what eat. Friend maybe decided something but dont remember. Eventually go in with our trays. I just end up go to line that had a line so that could observe the precedent of how u would get food. Friend was in front of me in line. Friend order something, say can order for me also i think. But end up i just order. Friend said sth like “MENCHIKATSU LARGE” i think, and i said sth similar, and it worked. That was not too bad. And then saw that side-dishes was you just take yourself. So took some. And also i believe friend went and got a hamburg from a different line.</p>
<p>And payment was you stood in a line and someone would look at you trays and calculate ur total and u give them payment and be on your way.</p>
<p>Idk how it was indicated that we pay together but somehow friend completed payment with me give them cash, and the payment lady gave us each a box of milk also which was nice.</p>
<p>Found some seats and sat down. Got up and bought drink from vending machine. I saw there was also self-water, got some water. Though i took two cups before realizing that i think there was a sign saying TAKE ONLY ONE CUP BRO. I also got some french dressing for my salad thing.</p>
<p>The food was pretty good, like def not awe-inspiring but def cost-performance good, and fulfilling, along with an environment that will slowly again never experience (existing among young people).</p>

</figure>
<p>Was lot of food, I barely managed to finish all my stuff. Eventually finish eat, put trays in tray collection, leave.</p>
<p>Walked around campus a bit more. Walked into this barn-museum area where u had to leave ur name and country of residence and stuff on a sign-in paper (but it was free). Walked around that. there were cow statues and stuff. and barn-related exhibits.</p>
<p>Eventually leave. And friend say along the lines of: OK i wanted to go to hokkaido univ. Now we went it. So now i do whatever, you decide.</p>
<p>Before it was planned potentially spend perhaps two days? in Sapporo. However it was decided leave now. Thus return to coin locker, retreive things, take a train northwest.</p>
<p>The fastest way to leave SAPPORO and go south is actually to go SOUTHEAST i believe. However i wanted to take a more scenic route which is GO NORTHWEST before eventually GOING SOUTH.</p>
<p>Take train northwest with terminal in OTARU. It was not sure whether to actually stop at OTARU or simply transfer to next train and go further.</p>
<p>However looking at hotel availability or so or idk, i believe was decided to simply sleep in OTARU.</p>
<p>So riding to OTARU terminal. However friend read a weather forecast and saw rain and thus wanted to buy an umbrella at a <ruby>MUJI<rt>無印良品</rt></ruby> shortly outside of <ruby>小樽築港駅<rt>a station</rt></ruby>, thus first stop there and go to the MUJI.</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/20241015_145824.webp" alt="" /><figcaption>this was train view out the back</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Arrive at the MUJI (it was in a shopping mall connected to train station). Look around for umbrellas, it could not find any it seemed. hmm. strange. Circled around shop like twice or so cannot find. So on behalf of friend I looked up the word Umbrella in Japanese which was KASA and walked up to an employee and looked like i was trying to find something and said “<ruby>KASA WA<rt>傘は</rt></ruby>”.. to which they guided us to front of store where the kasas were. I might have tried to say something like thank you but it was more like unintelligible mumble. luckily friend is better at saying thank you so maybe they said thank you.</p>
<section id="saying-thank-you" class="aside">
<h2>saying thank you</h2>
<p>i have managed to say various things in JAPANESE language. However <ruby>Thank You<rt>ありがとうございます</rt></ruby> still remained and remains a challenge for me. idk why. perhaps i am still trying to process its phonetics. or maybe situations never force me to actually say it so i can simply get by without saying it. not sure. each time i always thought, “wow now i will finally say it”. but then i fail to say it, and feel slightly rude.</p>
</section>
<p>So got the umbrella (muji has self-checkout) and took train up to OTARU STATION. i booked the hotel we staying at while waiting at the train platform i think. Also while waiting train platform friend bought coffee from vending machine and discovered it was hot, and thus we had come across our first WARM VENDING MACHINE i.e. vending machines that have been configured to dispensed warmed instead of chilled drinks. wow cool!.</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/20241015_153047.webp" alt="" /><figcaption>first time in my life seeing warm vending machine woww cool</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Get off OTARU STATION and walk over to hotel.</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/20241015_155337.webp" alt="" /><figcaption>idk what these people were doing but it looked neat</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Check in to the hotel. This hotel room was neat because it was Japanese-Style room i.e. tatami flooring and you sleep on futon (not couch).</p>
<p>Then exit hotel walk around, but go back to hotel bc friend wanted jacket, the reexit hotel, then walk around.</p>
<p>There was a “canal” popular tourist spot i think. Walk along canal. was cool. Take some pictures and etc.</p>
<p>Eventually was time for dinner, ask friend what is for dinner. After indecision, decide to eat OTARU some kind of like local representative food? which is– fried? baked? chicken thing.</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/20241015_171717.webp" alt="" /><figcaption>picture of street</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>So walked to that place and walked in. There was some kind of miscommunication trouble where i think person was asking if we was here for take-away food because they got that. Somehow eventually got seated at a table. The ordering process according to a card on the table was to order at counter and they would bring food over. So we did that; friend did the talking.</p>
<p>Received the food. i had a Chicken Meal and beer. It was OK in the beginning but the chicken gradually tasted salty af like almost inedible-level salty idk what was up with that. Probably worst meal had this trip i think.</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/20241015_173813.webp" alt="" /><figcaption>the chicken</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Finished food and left. Walk back to hotel, stopped by a convenience along the way because friend buy something. Also got him to include nonalcohol beer in his purchase because i wanted it. It was some kind of local beer it said i believe. It tasted very strange, like watered-down doppelbock. Not very great taste.</p>
<p>In the hotel room wash and go to sleep and stuff. I also enjoyed to sit watching some random NHK E kids program sipping on my nonalcoholic beer.</p>
