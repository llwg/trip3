<p>We woke up in the morning and went to NARITA AIRPORT in order to take the flight to SAPPORO that we had booked a week or so ahead of time nice.</p>
<p>In the airport friend had some issue with they bank or credit card orso and resolved that while walking to the terminal and while i used bathroom, nice.</p>
<p>Check-in process was completed with a self-kiosk digital. There was no passport needed i believe suprisingly (but also not suprisingly because it was a domestic flight so idrk why they would need it).</p>
<p>We ate breakfast at a MATSUYA before security, then went through security. I did not know if large liquids can go through security for domestic flights bc im pretty sure in usa its not allowed. So i just emptied some liquid bottle i had in bathroom and recycled bottle i believe. And went through security.</p>

<p>The flight was one of first flights i think ive been on where entire plane is i believe same type of seating. like there is no big seats at the front for high class and smaller seats in back for low class. Thus we was sitted near the front of the plane which was cool, i dont think ive ever sat near the front of plane.</p>

</figure>
<p>When getting to our seats i accidentally passed the row where we sitting and thus i just stood awkwardly behind the seats because other ppl was passing me getting to their seats and would have to somehow stop the flow of ppl in order to go in opposite direction to reach my seat.</p>
<p>However luckily an cabin attendant at front see so, walked over blocking incoming traffic and ask me is that ur seat (in japanese) which i somehow affirmed (idk how), and also the person with the row seat perceived and got up so can get to my middle seat. Thus the problem was solved.</p>
<section id="i-was-middle-seat" class="aside">
<h2>I was middle seat</h2>
<p>There was three seats (on each side of plane i think). Friend was Leftmost (window seat). I was middle seat. Stranger was rightmost (Aisle seat).</p>
</section>
<p>The flight (NRT to CTS) was short with no snack or drink or nothing. Out the left window could see many nice scenery of EASTNORTH japan and etc. and also Mount Fuji at the beginning which was cool. It was sunny and clear. Also i remember that the seatbelt orientation felt opposite of what i was was used to. I am not sure if it actually was or what the conventions of seatbelt orientation is.</p>

</figure>
<p>Soon arrived at CTS and take train to SAPPORO. Get off at SAPPORO STATION it was feel cold. Quite cold. I also recall that the imagery getting off train was cold and depressing and what I thought was “eastern european” (which I probably just envisioned as cold and depressing even though i have never been there).</p>
<p>Friend was gonna put stuff in coin locker but all of the lockers was full. Thus went to hotel and asked to hold bag until checkin time.</p>
<p>Then went to the YODOBASHI CAMERA to look for the rfid thingy i wanted. Site said had some stock of one product (though i think it said not on display). So friend asked about it for me to worker bc i did not want to, and worker guided to section with the relevant products. I bought the thingy, and friend a cable, and we left.</p>
<p>And then went to a uniqlo to buy some clothing. It was first time using fitting room in japan. However in this case it was just walked in, someone say use that one, and then u use it, and then walk out. interesting.</p>
<p>Then I believe it was time to eat. Friend want to eat “SOUP CURRY”, so went to a place. Here was the process.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>There was a queue for the restaurant, indicated by people sitting on chairs outside</li>
<li>Join queue by sitting on chairs, looking at menu.</li>
<li>Worker came out some time and perceived us and i think asked how many people we were and also gave us an english menu.</li>
<li>Some time later worker came out again and took our order. The order was slightly complicated in that there was multiple things you had to choose. however it went smoothly, they took order, and we continued waiting in queue.</li>
<li>Eventually called us into restaurant and seated us.</li>
<li>And then brought food over.</li>
<li>ate</li>
<li>bring the receipt to the front. they had a self-checkout thing where you just scan the receipt at the machine. and then you can pay into the machine. how convenient!</li>
</ol>
<p>The food was quite very yummy. also i ordered rice <ruby>large portion<rt>大盛</rt></ruby> and it was very large, one of largest <ruby>large-portion<rt>大盛</rt></ruby>s ive ever had.</p>

<p>When done, go to hotel and check in i think. Then i do not really remember what we did. All I remember is three general points:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Friend’s passport ID page was accidentally folded (sometime around this checkin process i think?) which caused them to be very stressed and want to e.g. contact some kind of embassy or consulate or idk, but end up they are closed because it was national holiday.</li>
<li>We briefly walked around a portion of HOKKAIDO UNIVERSITY</li>
<li>I took a nap in hotel room because i was very tired. And then when I awoke i decided i was still tired and wanted to simply go to sleep.</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall quite a depressing day, especially considering it was friends birthday.</p>
