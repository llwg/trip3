<p>Collect the belongings check out of hotel. Take a bus to Miyako station. One time a bus came and i turned away so they wouldnt stop for us but then friend said oh actually that bus can go to the station also. but it left. oops!.</p>
<p>We found way to the bus platform labelled to go to MORIOKA and then found ticket vending machine inside which only take the old money notes (which was inconvenient) and we bought two tickets to MORIOKA.</p>
<p>The bus arrived, it turned out i think we could have probably just used IC CARD oh well. We ride that bus across the country and arrive in MORIOKA in time for lunch. We went to a YAKINIKU place that is also known for their MORIOKA REIMEN. tbh i sort of liked the 육회비빔밥 that i also ordered better than the actual <ruby>REIMEN<rt>冷麺</rt></ruby> but all the food was nice and yummy.</p>

<p>After eating we walked around. I led the way to a coin laundry because i want to do laundry. I was slightly intimidated bc there was someone in there (but in the other room) cleaning. But i put my stuff in wash and discovered i dont have enough coins, and the change machine didnt accept new banknotes wow!. So i went outside idk try to go to convenience store exchange? But then i saw a vending machine with 100-yen water that accepted new banknotes so i bought one of those and got some 100-yen coins. And started wash.</p>
<p>While wash going, follow friend go walk outside. See a convenience store, I go in to withdraw cash. Friend also withdraw cash. For some reason the ATM dont let them withdraw not-a-multiple-of-10000 even though i just did maybe i used up all of the 1000-yen bills? idk. And so they tried to break a 10000-yen into 1000-yen bills at the convenience-store counter and there was a communication error, so i tried to help, and the communication went something like</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>pls give me ten 1000-yen bills or something for this 10000-yen bill</li>
<li>what are you going to use it for? Are u gonna charge (your ic card) or sth?</li>
<li>oh no (just want the change)</li>
<li>oh we cant just do <ruby>change<rt>両替</rt></ruby></li>
<li>oh ok bye</li>
</ol>
<p>That was an educational experience because i think i finally learned the word <ruby>両替<rt>ryougae</rt></ruby> (i dont actually know if that was the word). We went on our way, i followed friend to some kind of shopping center where they go look for CDs. I turned back and went to coin laundry because the laundry about to be done.</p>
<p>I entered the coin laundry. The person cleaning was now cleaning this room where the washer was but my inhibitions was sort of reduced so i went and stood in front of the machine. The machine was at 0 minutes and was completing its like final spin-dry cycle i think and i just stood there looking at it.</p>
<p>The person cleaning look over and say something like “wow first time ive seen that” (but in japanese). And then I had inhibition so i just did something like nodded and tried to look cute. And they said something like “Hmm yeah it is zero but its still going, interesting”. And I probably nodded again and tried to look cute again. And also like sort of walked away so it wouldnt be weird, and then it finished and i took my stuff out.</p>
<p>And then i left the washer, but then the washer door closed, and i hate when washer doors close bc it doesnt air out well so i went back to sort of like open it or see if you can leave it open. It dont really seem like it can. But the cleaning person said something to me and idk what they said and then they repeated what they said which sounded like <ruby>NOKOTTEMASENKA<rt>のこってませんか</rt></ruby> and then peered in the washer with me and said sth like <ruby>ないですね<rt>ok nope</rt></ruby>, and i went on my way. idk if these were the actual words but maybe they were. I looked up NOKORU later and seemed like it might have meant they meant “did you leave something in there” which makes sense.</p>
<p>I put my stuff in drier. i didnt have enough coins again but i have an old 500-yen coin so i went to use the change machine and the person was there again so i tried to look innocent while using the change machine, put in 200 yen for 18 mins of drying, and left.</p>
<p>18 mins is actually not a very long time, so i just walked around the area a bit. And then came back and then folded some clothing while giving extra 9 minutes to other thicker clothing. There was a cool bench made out of like drier-doors which was cool. Eventually finish all laundry, walk over to meet friend.</p>

<p>Met friend back in the shopping thing they was shopping in, and then went walk over to the areas where both our hotels was located and went to go check in into our respective hotels. The check-in person who checked me in i think was trying to mentally process what to say in english and i felt kind of bad i just stood there in silence while they appeared to be struggling, maybe i should have said sth like u can do it in japanese if u want, but i didnt. and then i think just gave up and showed me the information sheet thing and said sth like “information” and let me go.</p>
<p>I lied on bed for a little and realised i was probably really tired and remembered last trip when i fell asleep on hotel bed at like 3pm. I think i was indeed quite tired and/or alcohol affected because i barely remembered anything from this night after this point except dinner, and i took no pictures to help me remember.</p>
<p>I followed friend walk to IWATE UNIVERSITY where they asked a person that was conversing in english where to get school merch and they directed us to go through the cafeteria past the atm there is like a bookstore thingy have a little section of goods. So went there and then friend asked via translator some worker there wheres the goods and then they guided to the goods table (which we literally walked past on the way in) and friend bought a good and we took pictures in a gravel lot and then went to go eat dinner.</p>
<p>For dinner we ate at small restaurant serving MORIOKA JYAJYAMEN, i believe they declare themselves as the Originator Of Morioka Jyajyamen. When we was ordering, we ordered two orders of gyoza and the server said sth like “There’s Eight in each serving u good?” or something and i thought they said Three in each serving or sth so i said uh ok then Three (servings) and then ig in a mix of me not being able to speak japanese and also that response not making any sense, they said “oh one?” and then idrk happened, i think friend clarified that they probably said Eight. but decided on two servings. Later someone came out and showed us the pack of frozen gyoza that they use and say sth like “one serving is this many, you good?” and we said yeah.</p>
<p>The noodles came out, served by old lady i think, who like took out each of the condiments on the table and introduced them and said to put them on the noodles and mix it up. Friend i think said something to them like “Famous food” (in japanese). and i think she asked sth like “Taiwan?” ig asking if we came from taiwan?idrked. and i or we responded sth like America. and i dont remember there was much any further conversation.</p>
<p>The noodles was tasty, but the highlight was the thing where after ur almost done with the noodles you crack a raw egg into ur leftover stuff and stir it up and then they pour umm idrk noodle water? not sure. into the bowl to make you like a nice soup. the lady told us again some condiments to add into the soup to enjoy it. That soup tasted very good. Friend paid and we left. Friend i remember send friendly words like It Was Very Delicious (in japanese) to the people while leaving which was good because i shared same sentiment but had never succeeded in saying something like that.</p>
