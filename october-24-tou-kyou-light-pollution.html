<p>I awoke and went to the hotel’s i believe Onsen. It was a nice place to bathe. iirc you could see sakurajima from the window. I do not actually remember if you could though. The hotel information card said to bring your own towel i believe and i forgot to bring mine. but luckily they actually had towels there.</p>
<p>Then I gather my stuff and go downstairs and eat at the breakfast <ruby>buffet<rt>viking</rt></ruby>. It was biggest hotel breakfast i had in japan. And kinda fancy also because they e.g. name the sources of some of the stuff, like I think there was a Weiners made with pork from Kagoshima(?) And a chicken nuggets made with um I forget but they did label it. And eggs from I forget also.</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/20241024_080259.webp" alt="" /><figcaption>my first plate of stuff</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There was lots of stuff to try, especially given the nature of the trays-shape that encouraged to take like just 1 of everything. It was a great and fun time. They also had a bathroom which I used.</p>
<p>As I was wrapping up I checked my flight booking confirmation to check what time it departs. I knew it was like 10:something and i thought it was around 10:50 vaguely, idrked. But then I saw it was 10:15. And the current time was um idrk when but based on my reasoning, between 8:30 and 9:00.</p>
<p>And according to google maps, via public transportation i would arrive earliest 10:00 which was kind of scary. I got up and left to go. Based on my observation of other tables, seem to leave you just get up and go and workers clean up the tables. So I do that. I check out by give room card front and they say ok thx and i left.</p>
<p>Walk out the hotel. There was a bus in front of hotel, I wonder if I can take that bus. But look at schedule posted it seemed that I could not take that bus and be timely. and if the bus did not go where i needed it to go that would be terrible and i would probably not make it to airport in time.</p>
<p>So I walked to bus stop as instructed by google maps. I was waiting. I wondered if I would make it to flight. Arrive right at terminal at 10:00 would that be enough time to check in, get through security, find gate??. idked. I kind of start panic.</p>
<p>The general route I musted take was Current location to KAGOSHIMA-CHUUO station where i would then take the Airport Bus to the Airport. The Airport Buses is scheduled to leave every ~10 minutes, and google map say that i would take the 9:15 bus (if everything went according to plan), and arrive at airport at 10:00.</p>
<p>Will it all go to plan..?. I was very nervous. I walked back to hotel and looked at that hotel bus. idk what it was doing. I walked back to regular bus stop. Then I think: maybe I can take a taxi to KAGOSHIMACHUUO station. it will be faster. then I can get earlier airport bus. But i never have taken a taxi in japan. And there is not really taxis driving all over past me.</p>
<p>I know there is TAXI APP i can use maybe to call over a taxi or something. Maybe specify destination too?. I download app. It requires phone number. I do not have USA sim card in phone. I only have Japan DATA sim card in. I open backpack ready to swap sim card. But then I think: my USA sim card dont have data. so I could receive verification message but not actually verify. I had headache. I decide do not use taxi app.</p>
<p>I waiting for bus. I think actually scheduled bus time arrived or almost arrived. I do not really remember. Bus not coming though. city buses that ive taken in japan generally are like 2 or 5 or 10 mins late often. But then I see in distance: A taxi-looking thing with a red light in it. Actually I don’t think the color of the light has any significance but I thought it did at the time i think.</p>
<p>I put up my hand and the taxi pulled over and opened the door and i got in and i said i think: “CHUUOEKI (onegaishimasu?)”. I don’t actually remember if i said onegaisimasu. if i did it was probably really small and driver probably didnt actually really hear bc i think they said in response CHUUOEKI(something else)? confirming i think . and maybe i affirmed that. but actually I do not really remember it was all a blur.</p>
<p>I do not think I have ever consciously or much unconsciously learned how to ride a taxi, actually in any country. Actually I remember now that I rode in a taxi once, in Taiwan, but with other people who did the hailing and money-handling. This was definitely first time in life I was riding taxi alone in any country. And idrked what was going on, but it was going on. the only thing i knew about japan taxis in particular was that the passenger is controlled by driver so i kept that in mind and assumed everything else was about the same as um.. other taxis? in the world? idk.</p>
<p>I sat in the taxi as it drove it along. It was the first time I sat in non-big-bus vehicle in Japan I think. It was a nice interior, I think. idk I don’t have pictures. There was a meter in the front. It went up.</p>
<p>I tracked ride in google maps. When approach near station I pulled out approx estimated fare. The fare went up in increments of 50-yen so I prepared a 50-yen coin, and some 100-yen coins. So that I could easily adjust to final amount.</p>
<p>Taxi pulled up to station. Driver maybe told me the amount (i dont remember). I put the money in the um like middle thing between the two front seats which kinda looked like a money tray. And they said sth like CHOU(ZU?)DESUNE. And open door. And i left. I don’t think I said thank you, or anything, as usual. Or maybe I tried to. Maybe I made some vocal-cord vibrations that could have been interpreted as a thanks bye. I am not sure.</p>
<section id="what-is-chouzu" class="aside">
<h2>What is chouzu</h2>
<p>What is that word. I am pretty sure it was not the word Choudo which is only other word i know that is relevant in the relevant contexts. The last syllable was not Do I am pretty sure. Also why did I only ever encounter it in my life exactly both times i paid cash in kagoshima. Does anyone know what word they said. Can anyone explain. please contact me if you do.</p>
</section>
<p>I was slightly panic state and i run around (literally) trying to see where tf the airport bus is. I see some um regular buses i think but dont see any airport-labelled bus. oh my goodness.</p>
<p>I see an information center. I go into the information center. There is exactly two people. Both rise to attention. As I approach the counter I wonder in my brain which person do I approach bro. Why are there exactly two people that are equally risen and equally equidistant. Why do I have to chose. oh my goodness.</p>
<p>I approach the person on the right and say something like <ruby>KUUKOU NO BASU WA<rt>AIRPORT BUS</rt></ruby>. and i remember a really brief moment in time where i sort of stop talking and observe if they are understanding me. if they already have understood what i am asking and are ready to speak. I cannot discern. they do not seem ready to speak. So I continue. <ruby>DOKO DESUKA<rt>WHERE IS</rt></ruby>. And then the person has a map and um shows me something on the map and seems to tell me that the airport bus is there. And then they explain in detail how to get there from here which was like um you go to a thing, and then go through the thing. uh and idrk idk japanese but im sure it would have been very helpful if i fully understood everything.</p>
<p>I think i did try to say thank you and that it probably came out like a nonsensical string of throat vibrations but at least i tried, and I left in a hurry, and went in the direction they said and roughly tried to guess and follow. There were some helpful signs so i followed the signs (I thought). I ran through some kind of underground passage. I went up some stairs or sth and reach surface, and it seems like theres no airport bus. hmm oops. I go back down and retrace steps and discover I did not properly follow the signs. So I followed the signs more and then I finally arrived, And saw the airport bus.</p>
<p>The airport bus was there. It looked like it was about to leave. I looked myself to be in a hurry and omg the bus! I want to ride the bus omg. And the person directing the bus i think somehow indicated yo come on the bus bro all chill or so so I did that I got on the bus. And then I was greeted with the kagoshima RapiCa IC sensor thing. Uh oh!. I tried scanning my suica card. The bus driver said to me something like “Oh <ruby>suica tsukaemasen<rt>you can't use suica</rt></ruby>” and I said “Oh <ruby>tsukaemasu<rt>I can</rt></ruby>?” and then they were like “No, <ruby>tukaemasen<rt>You can't</rt></ruby>” and then i said ohh lol and pulled out my wallet.</p>
<p>Tbh I didn’t even know what the fare was i think so idk what i was doing. But I was fishing around for a 1000-yen bill to put in the change machine but i only found a 5000-yen bill in the heat of the moment and like tried to put it in the change machine??(i dont think literally any change machine will accept 5000-yen bills). And the driver said sth like ohh umm that wont work lol (dont actually remember what they said). And then they asked me several questions. Perhaps the first question was if I am japanese (in japanese). idrk why they asked this because even after I said no they continued speaking to me in japanese. or actually maybe it was related to the next question, which was: (???). I don’t know what they asked. They asked something which contained a word I did not know. Retrospectively, I think it was <ruby>KOKUSAI<rt>international</rt></ruby>. I said in response: (That word)?? confusedly like idked what it meant. But then i think they said something that prompted me to understand that they was asking if i was flying internationally or domestically, to which i responded <ruby>KOKUNAI<rt>domestic</rt></ruby>. And then they asked me what airline i was flying, to which i responded with like “JETTO star”. And then they say: I’ll give you change when you get off. Except in japanese so i didnt exactly 100% understand, but i had like 80% confidence that that’s what they said.</p>
<p>Phew ok! maybe i tried to say thank you again and then went into the seats section of bus which i discovered was really full!. There was even like a person that seemed to be sitting in the middle of aisle which did not really make sense but I just was in a hurry to sit down. and I kind of forcibly sat down next to a big guy who put stuff in the seat next to them so i like body-languaged until they yielded the seat to me.</p>
<p>The bus depart and go on its way. Oh my goodness!.</p>
<p>On the way to the airport I did several things. One of them was notice that there were seats in the aisle that fold down so people can sit in the aisle. I guess that explained how/why there was a person sitting in the aisle. and I guess I should not have forcibly sat down next to someone oops that was a bit awkward.</p>
<p>Another thing I did was figure out that the driver probably asked me those questions to discern which stop i was getting off, because the bus stopped at three stops (terminals?): One stop for international, One for domestic (some airlines), Another for domestic (some more airlines).</p>
<p>And the other thing I did was check into my flight online. Because I figure it would save time. It is good that I checked in online because it said the deadtime to check in to flight was some time before I would arrive at the airport. Thankfully I checked into the flight online with no problems. That was fantastic, thank you JetStar.</p>
<p>I was the last stop. The bus arrived at like 10:55. I got off the bus. The driver helping people unload they luggage from bottom of bus. I was kind of anxious just go to get flight so i walked into airport, think to just not get my change. But then airport looked kind of confusing and i didnt really know where to go. I looked back outside and it seem like driver done so i went back outside. The driver saw me and recognised me gave a “!!omg <ruby>yokatta<rt>phew</rt></ruby>” and maybe said sth else i dont remember and gave me my change and i think said thx and perhaps even a friendly pat on back. i do not remember my response but i hope it was nice and thankful. thanks that guy fr that was very chill of them. Oh also another thing I did on the bus was realise i could probably have paid the fare with the resources in my wallet normally if i had just calculated it ahead of time and also found the 1000-yen bill that was in there.</p>
<p>I went into the airport again. On the map there were three security checkpoints i think. I was guessing one corresponding with each area/bus stop. So I went to the third one. I do not actually know if they went to different gates but someone checked my boarding pass (on my phone) before i went through security so im guessing they would have told me if i got the wrong security.</p>
<p>Got through security and saw ran over to my gate. I was behind another guy that was running to the gate. They scan the boarding pass (digital, wow!) and i go on plane and go to seat which was the window seat on the right (facing out south).</p>
<p>The view from plane was mostly just water, and like once or twice some small islands which was neat. Soon arrive at NRT. I walked a kinda really long way to the train area. At the train area there were a lot of train options and idrked what to take. I did not want to buy a special ticket. I saw there is just regular express train you can ride so i beeped into the gate. I actually think I beeped into two gates idk what was up with that. maybe I am hallucinating that fact but im pretty sure I did. I also bought grape gummies from a snack vending machine. and a vitamin drink i think. and water i think.</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/20241024_115623.webp" alt="" /><figcaption>saw this bird at the aiport</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The train arrive and i took the train. Except the train was not actually the train i wanted i think so i got off at (keisei?)Narita(station) and waited for train I wanted and rode that.</p>
<p>The train ride was kinda long. And I had to walk all the way to the train area to ride it. and end up transferring. And its terminal is Ueno??. Honestly not great. I probably would have saved both time and money if I had just taken the bus. But at least I got the grape gummies. And it is slightly more fun to ride the train for me.</p>
<p>Eventually after a bunch of train riding and transfers and stuff I arrived at the place to meet friend, which was somewhere in um like Nagatachou. Walked around some places, idrk what we was doing just observing the city which just looked like big buildings. At some point friend asked what i would do if i was alone and i would say get a snack because i was hungry (I had not eaten lunch). So we went into a familymart to buy a snack.</p>
<p>I picked out a pack of sushi and a beer. And i look see they got a warm-food box with FAMICHIKI inside it and figured it was now time to try FAMICHIKI because i had been wanting to try it.</p>
<p>One problem though was that there was no person at the register, and i needed a person to buy the beer and also to get the famichiki. So i think i pressed something that looked like a bell next to the sign left on the counter that said to ring the bell if u need someone. But actually I don’t think that was the bell so I pressed the other thing that kinda looked pressable and I think that worked. The worker appeared out of idrk where and went inside the little register thing. I remember when they was like organizing stuff or sth in a hurry some stuff(s) kept dropping on the floor accidentally and they were like oops sorry mb oops. I said to them at some point approx “(And) one famichiki (pls)” (except in japanese) and they gave me one and then also asked if i wanted bag and i said yes pls and um yes eventually i got my stuff.</p>
<p>This was a milestone in my capabilities of communication, because i think it was both first time i had responded verbally to indicate i wanted a bag, and also first time i had requested something from the hot food box. Wow cool.</p>
<p>Friend get some stuff say: wheres the self register. and i pointed to back. but actually they was in the front i dont think there was one in the back. and friend check out via worker.</p>
<p>We take our stuff and looking for a park on google maps. We walked over to a river which think maybe theres a bench along the river or something. There was no benches over there or even river-view. Instead we walked into some area with like a car dealership and expensive hotel or something. And there was place across the street that was like a little plaza you can sit at a fountain, so we went over there sat down eating.</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/20241024_150709.webp" alt="" /><figcaption>yummm</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>My food was good.</p>
<ul>
<li>Familymart sushi tastes pretty good like i have not tasted any sushi better than it though idk i dont have developed raw fish tastes. And they include a little thing of 本wasabi, great.</li>
<li>Famichiki my first time eat it. It tastes good. I am pretty sure it wasn’t reconstituted meat iirc. actually idk. it tasted like a really juicy slab of thigh meat. it was good. I recommend.</li>
<li>Beer I ate was Asahi “Dry Crystal”. It tasted like I assume a watered down Asahi Super Dry. Will probably just get regular Super Dry in the future unless i specifically want the lower ABV. the can looked kinda cool though</li>
</ul>
<p>After finishing up, Friend said sth like do you want to go to American Embassy(?) and I said OK and so followed them. End up not go to to the embassy but like the dormitory of the embassy??. And then they have security fence and stuff so there is not much to see so we wandered around and found some playground and also a shrine.</p>
<p>And then we wandered out of there and then I think somewhat decided to walk into Roppongi. So we walked and then eventually saw signs that indicated we were probably in Roppongi so we had successfully walked to Roppongi.</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/20241024_160031.webp" alt="" /><figcaption>some street</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Idrk what is Roppongi so there was not really much to see except city. I believe we went into a random grocery store and looked around and came out. And we walking on when friend was browsing google maps and said omg!! there is a coffee shop here that I know in USA. and he go there and i follow he.</p>
<section id="friend-wants-me-to-use-him-to-refer-to-him" class="aside">
<h2>Friend wants me to use Him to refer to him</h2>
<p>Them is usually my default pronoun for animate beings but while writing this writing, friend say that He want me to use Him pronoun for Him, so now I will use the pronoun Him to refer to Him now, and also i roughly changed previous occurences to He where i came across them.</p>
</section>
<p>Friend saw the coffee shop and um it was probably about the time for dinner so we think what to eat for dinner. We walking around saw a singapore restaurant. I thought: oh ok lets go. But friend um did not really want to go and also it was open at 5:30 i think, i.e. not open yet. So we went a big building thing and looked at list of restaurants and none of them looked appealing/did not open yet so we went outside and sat down and friend looked through google maps or sth looking for restaurants. Eventually they decided some chinese restaurant OK let’s go there.</p>
<p>First used the big building bathroom then leave and walk to the chinese restaurant which was next to the singapore restaurant and also opened at 5:30. We waited outside in the hallway until some time around 5:30 someone like peeked out and saw us and we go in become seated.</p>
<p>The restaurant had fancy restaurant vibes i.e. cloth napkins and uh plates laid out on the table or sth. Server bring over menu we look at the menu.</p>
<p>I do not remember exactly what happened at the restaurant any more. Maybe because of alcohol I had both before and during this meal. I do remember a loose set of things that happened though. I will list them. They are listed in approximate order of when they happened, though I do not actually know the actual order.</p>
<ul>
<li>We stared at the menu for a long time deciding. At some point someone came over ask us what drinks we want. I was not really planning on drinking but I ordered beer.</li>
<li>Everything was quite expensive. At least compared with every other food we ate in japan.</li>
<li>They gave drinks and also peanuts</li>
<li>I think the (family that ran restaurant?) was gossiping(?) about us in Chinese. I think at one point they was like theorizing if we spoke Chinese.</li>
<li>The server asked where we was from. Friend respond in a Mandarin Chinese. I also tried to do that.</li>
<li>We ordered two dishes and one soup (which was like same price as dish i think).</li>
<li>Each dish came out separately with gap in time between each dish. Interesting.</li>
<li>The first dish that came out was the dish i picked, meat with peppers. The person asked us something in Japanese that was I think something about if we wanted it split up or something. But I thought it was just ask if we want two plates or sth. idk but our response caused them to lay out two small plates and spoon the one big dish into the two small plates so friend and I ate separately.</li>
<li>There was no rice. Eventually i asked server if they have rice but i think they confused my question with asking if they have the rice dish that we ordered so they said Uh yeah in a bit but then i was like uh oh i mean like and then other person said <ruby>White rice<rt>siroi gohan</rt></ruby>? and uh oh yeah thx. Yeah one pls thx. And they brought one out.</li>
<li>The second dish was the Soup. i never knew that soup was served as like a dish you just eat by itself but thats what it was served like.</li>
<li>The last dish was the friend picked dish which was um like some kind of seafood over rice thing</li>
<li>We was the only ones in the restaurant until some group of people showed up and eating.</li>
<li>I heard also they got a phone call making a (group i think) reservation. The vibe of restaurant was indeed like people would use it as like company meal or something.</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="media/20241024_174822.webp" alt="" /><figcaption>my plate of meat with peppers</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Um we finished eating and i pay. When was paying friend saw they have some picture with some kind of political figure and they thought that was impressive or funny or idrk and asked if can take a picture of their picture and they said yeah and friend took it and we left</p>
<p>After exiting we walked around i dont actually know where. I remember we bantered about whether some truck was bigger or not than an Ford F150, and i for the first time looked up and noticed that tokyo, or at least the place we were standing at, had terrible light pollution, an orange haze, it was kinda really bad.</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/20241024_185429.webp" alt="" /><figcaption>what the heck</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We arrived at a train station, friend take one line and i take the other so we say goodbye. I take some trains to transfer to: TSUKUBA EXPRESS.</p>
<p>TSUKUBA EXPRESS is train line that go to TSUKUBA city, which i going to tonight. A train come and I get on. I think that actually I got on a not-very-express train, suboptimal journey, oops.</p>
<p>The train was kind of crowded for a while and eventually became less crowded. I remarked this about the people of the train: That there is only one person i see who is not looking at they phone, who is also one of only person i dont see in business-style clothing. Also that one salaryman is sipping a can of alcohol as casually as if it was some leftover soda pop</p>
<p>After about an hour train ride on the TUKUBAEXPRESS it reached the terminal i.e. TSUKUBA where i got off and walked to hotel. i passed by e.g. some big parking thing with store signs on it. and a convenience store with parking lot outside. There was also a crosswalk that you have to manually press and that some people just crossed whenever car wasnt come regardless of signal. I arrived, checked into hotel, washsleep.</p>
