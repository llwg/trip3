<p>Today I woke up and visit a Matsuya in the area and eat breakfast/lunch there. I visit a DAISO in the area looking for some packing materials to pack the stuff i bought yesterday in a box to check it in as a checked luggage (it contains big liquids cannot carry on flight). I was also concerned about i have to buy some chocolates that a coworker requested and then put it in checked baggage. but i checked my messages and saw they said chocolate probably will melt in checked baggage so if got a connection flight no need to try to get the chocolates. so i dont have to OK.</p>

<p>DAISO didnt have much stuff that looked suitable to Put Stuff In and Check it in as check-in luggage. So I google “Cardboard Box” on google and then some packing-materials shop popped up and it is sort of nearby, I take the train there. It was pretty large and nice variety of all sorts of packaging materials n stuff. I would have spent more time there browsing for fun if i was not carrying whole lotta stuff along with me. I selected and bought a cardboard box and some tape and purchased it and they had a table where i assembled the cardboard box and put stuff in it and etc. So I exited the store with my stuff in a cardboard box in a bag and walk on.</p>
<p>Next I went to OOMORI and walked over to its MEGA DON QUIJOTE where i walked around the store a long time and buy a pack of undershirts that i saw in hakodate don quihote and thought: oh maybe i should buy those later. I went through a self-checkout where i sorta struggled to understand the prompts (i dont think there was an english option) and um it said sth about like uh bags and scan bag..? idrked. At some point somebody came over did something, i thought it was like see wth im doing. But now that i came back home and saw the package of undershirts, I see there is a PAID sticker on the undershirts so i wonder if the person stuck that sticker on. uh maybe because uh. idk maybe they just do that.</p>
<p>I eventually paid and got out, and then walked over to SUSHIRO, the revolving-sushi chain restaurant. They have a machine outside u just say how many ppl u are and it tells u where to go sit. I do that. You order on tablet. Stuff comes out on conveyer belt. Except the Beer i ordered and the Platter thing i ordered. those someone brought out manually. And also you have to press the “yes i am drinking age” prompt on the tablet when order beer.</p>

<p>It was nice i just eating stuff. I ate a horse sashimi it was chewy. And lots of various fish n stuff.</p>
<p>At some point at the end i ordered some kind of fish with cheese. But it seemed i got a duplicate of a fish with onions i got before. Hmm. i thought: oh well maybe i pressed the wrong one or idk. And actually i was about to eat it when a worker came over and talked to me. I didnt know what they was talking about tbh i just sort of nodded idked. And then they uhh, i dont really know. But then they said some words that i understood to mean that the sushi person made a mistake i think. And they like scrolled through my orders which was in english. And like idrk and uhh i had not much clue what was going on still or what is the usual action taken in these kinds of scenarios so i said like daijoubu desu or something um i think they apologised and then left. Was they trying to take the onion fish back or something? i honestly have no clue what happened, i was pretty tired and also disoriented by the beer and idk japanese. But at some point when i looked up i saw that a fish with cheese had been delivered to me so i ate it. idk if they charged me extra for it because i also ate the onion fish they sent out but.</p>
<p>I finished up, paid at the self-register, left. Nice meal. except imo the small beer i got was overpriced especially considering its a chain restaurant. I rode some trains to the airport. I put my newly purchased undershirts in my cardboard box and taped it up. Checked in via self-kiosk and then I went to the Bag Drop to check in my cardboard box. Went through security. I tried to ask if i could not do the cylindrical scanny machine things made by Leidos but the person asked me like “do u have heart machine thingy in u” and i said no and they said sth like just go through the thing ur fine.</p>
<p>For some reason the machine actually did not seem very X-ray-y and like the workers was standing right next to the machine so i thought: oh well maybe it actually isnt Xray or whatever and it isnt very harmful. so i just went through. Looking it up afterwards i believe the machine indeed was not XRAY ionizing radiation etc. so yay i guess.</p>
<p>In the airport terminal i went to a convenience store and bought a bunch of alcohol and snacks and pocari sweat to eat with alcohol. After i bought that, i thought: maybe i didnt get enough alcohol. like maybe i want to drink some alcohol during my layover or sth. So i returned and bought more alcohol.</p>
<p>I take all my stuff go over sat at some table. I drank alcohol and ate my snacks. Squid snack and rice crackers, yum. I opened all the alcohol had a taste of all of them. After beginning to consume the alcohol i realised i probably should have not bought so much alcohol and that alcohol tastes bad and etc. So I drank a bit more and finished up my snacks. I dumped the remainder of the sake i had in bathroom. and kept the little cylinder of shochu in my bag in case idk what (i just threw it away when i got to next airport).</p>
