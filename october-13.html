<p>As somewhat expected, I awoke around 4am or so. I seem to always woke up around that time the first day(s) when arrive into this time zone. Or maybe I first awoke midnight. I am not sure. I awoke many times during the sleep I believe. Some time around I think 5am I felt the room slightly wobble or something and I wondered if that was an earthquake. I asked friend who I believe turned on they phone screen shortly after the earthquake occured and apparently it was.</p>
<p>I did not fall asleep after that. However friend did, I think. I went out to take morning walk around Mejiro which was just ppls houses essentially.</p>

<p>Returned to hotel. With friend, exited hotel and walked south to eat breakfast at a Denny’s. The Denny’s order experience was:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>walk into the Denny’s</li>
<li>someone might have told us to sit wherever we want (maybe not)</li>
<li>sit wherever we want</li>
<li>touch the tablet in order to order food</li>
<li>Wait for food to be served by a person</li>
</ol>
<p>while we was waiting for the food, we discussed things, but also whether the water was free or not.</p>
<p>Based on my experiences now, I believe it was free. however this was before experiences, and it was unclear. we discussed how to ask someone whether water was free.</p>
<p>Eventually the person came with our food. I think they said something that we both didnt understand. Perhaps it was like “is that everything (that you ordered)?”, idk. However i think when we acted confused they said something in english. i think which prompted friend to ask if water was free (in english). and then i think they replied something abt it could/should have come with “drink bar” or sth as part of the deal. but actually friend didnt order the “drink bar” as part of they meal. and then person said that they can go modify the order or so. thanks that person!.</p>

</figure>
<p>but actually I think friend didnt end up drinking any water. We ate the food and went to go pay. This involves bringing the receipt thing they put in the little plastic tube at ur table up to the front counter.</p>
<p>They said sth abt the modification of drink bar and then friend said oh actually i just didnt drink anything. and then i think person said something along lines of i think: oh oops i already modified it let me umm modify it again (or sth, im not really sure). so then they did some stuff (thank you) and then i payed with credit card and we left. And so ended my first family-restaurant experience.</p>
<section id="the-family-restaurant-experience" class="aside">
<h2>the family-restaurant experience</h2>
<p>I had never eaten at family restaurant in Japan until now because scared to go in alone. However after trying it now and several times in the future, it was great and nice. There is people eating alone, and also many chain family restaurants have tablet order and/or self-pay so it is actually less socially anxiety than regular restaurant. It is a great variety of restaurant.</p>
</section>
<p>Walked around Mejiro area. around university. University seemed closed to public, so did not enter.</p>
<p>Walked back to hotel, retreive belongings, check out of hotel. Briefly stopped by convenience store across street to buy um.. i just remember Masks but might have been other stuff also.</p>
<p>We then went to Shibuya in order to purchase glasses. I forgot to mention this but part of pre-trip planning was plan to purchase glasses in japan.</p>
<section id="person-that-asked-us-for-directions" class="aside">
<h2>person that asked us for directions</h2>
<p>I believe it was here that we was waiting at MEJIRO for train to SHIBUYA and someone came up to us and showed us translator screen from i think chinese to japanese asking sth like um tokyo station uhh bus? idrk, idk japanese.</p>
<p>i dont really know what we said, maybe we just looked confused. And then they said sth (in english?) like i wanna go to tokyo station, which train do i take? (between these two tracks). We were standing on YAMANOTE-LINE platform with one track going clockwise and the other going counter-clockwise i think. And so i tried to say sth like yamanote is a loop so it doesnt really matter which direction you take but if you look at this map, going through UENO is probably slightly faster (not sure if true). so they went and took that train. And we missed ours going the other way but luckily it come every few mins so we didnt wait for much for next one</p>
</section>
<p>At the glasses place, decide the frames. Then friend begin process of purchase. I did not yet do it because i was not actually sure if wanted to buy glasses. and wished to simply observe the process before going through.</p>
<p>The process was as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>complete a process on an electronic kiosk</li>
<li>some person will do something maybe and send you to a different people</li>
<li>different people will do stuff like asking ur prescription and verifying prescription based on ur current glasses. And getting the frames u want. and asking what lens options u want. then they send u to someone else</li>
<li>The someone else will then adjust frames to ur head i think. and then collect ur payment and stuff</li>
</ol>
<p>When all was done, it was um around 1pm i believe. Original plan was to eat Vietnamese food around the area then go to Yoyogi Park to enjoy an Event. however it was already late and Event had higher priority thus Went To The Park without eating.</p>
<p>The event was pretty Chill it was People dancing to Rock n Roll In The park.</p>
<p>After observing the people in the park, go to eat. It was decided to eat a convenience store food orso in the area so that it can return to the park in quicker time in order to continue observing. However, saw a MOS BURGER which i had always wanted to try, thus went to MOS BURGER. The self-order kiosk was only in japanese i think. however, use it order. get a pager sit down wait for food at a table.</p>
<p>They had a very nice hand-washing sink with paper towels. that was great. Got food and ate it. it was tasty food, top-tier burger.</p>

</figure>
<p>Returned to the park fulfilled. Observe people longer until seem like they say goodbyes to each other and disperse.</p>

<p>Returning to Shibuya in order to pick up one of Friend’s glasses which was ready same-day. Along the way we ran into parade of politics people i think. We decided to walk behind the parade a bit. The parade had a band on a truck playing groovy music, which was fun.</p>
<p>Got to glasses place, friend got they glasses, and I went through process order a pair of my own.</p>
<p>Then, went to eat vietnamese food. it was yummy. Vietnamese restaurant eating process:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>enter</li>
<li>somehow communicated that we was two ppl</li>
<li>they brought over some water thx</li>
<li>was a QR-code menu ordering system thing. order on phone.</li>
<li>They bring food
<ul>
<li>i struggled to say “thank you” (in japanese) as usual. my failure to say “thank you” felt even more disrespectful in the context of this restaurant, idk why. However luckily friend said it normally it seems.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Eat food</li>
<li>In order to pay, went up to front counter. I was going to pay with card i had my card ready. But then there was sign saying CASH ONLY. Thus last minute pulled out cash oops.</li>
<li>Leave. i think friend said thank you again. thank you friend for saying thank you!</li>
</ol>

<p>Then, took a train to Narita (city) which was where we was staying for the night. We stay there because flight next day morning. Originally i think planned to eat dinner in Narita. however end up just arriving there and wash, go to sleep I believe (because we had eaten dinner in shibuya already).</p>
<section id="find-rfid-error-sheet-progress" class="aside">
<h2>find rfid-error-sheet progress</h2>
<p>some time when returning to shibuya i think stopped by a bic camera and also a daiso to look for that rfid-error-sheet something. nobody had it. however i looked it up online and i saw yodobashi camera had one. so it was determined to perhaps get it at e.g. shinjuku yodobashi orso. however later in evening it was decided that was not along the way. simply skip shinjuku go to narita. anyways can get it at yodobashi elsewhere in country.</p>
