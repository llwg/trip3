<p>Today we woke up. For breakfast we exited hotel and walked over to a BIKKURI DONKEY which i did not actually know what it was but turns out it is a HAMBURG (family) RESTAURANT. The process was as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Enter</li>
<li>The person might see and probably asked 二名様ですか orso etc.</li>
<li>Become seated</li>
<li>I think they came over and said sth about now the ordering being on tablets. Thats what i think they said but idk bc neither of our persons know japanese very much. Ive never been to a bikkuri donkey before so idk if the ordering used to be indeed not on tablets.</li>
<li>Place order on tablet</li>
<li>They bring stuff over</li>
<li>Eat</li>
<li>When done eating, bring receipt(s) they gave you (in ur plastic table tube) to the front. They had a self-checkout i.e. you just scan the receipt and do payment on machine. How easy!. done.</li>
</ol>

<h2>when they bring food over</h2>
<p>When server brings over food it always feel awkward for me. I have never fully learned what the actual social script is supposed to be like. The server comes over and says sth like “Who ordered the &lt;?&gt;” and you indicate who ordered the &lt;?&gt; and they give that person the food. This continues. Im guessing you should probably say thank you. But if you dont what do you do? just blankly stare into space trying to act as a neutral entity of the restaurant? um. idk. I forget what i was writing about.</p>
<p>And then they will often ask you something like “Is that everything you ordered?” In japanese. I think they might ask this in different ways. I forget exactly what they ask in japanese. Also idek if thats what they ask all the time. but i think it is.</p>
</section>
<p>I had a small um hamburg set and also a TAMAGOKAKEGOHAN. pretty yummy stuff.</p>

<p>Leave, go back to hotel. Friend do laundry because He got new clothes to wash and also gonna wash old clothes that i request can i use because i am pretty chilly could use more clothes. So he do that. He told me he meet some funny character while drying they clothes and end up drying they clothes together. which i still dont really know was a real person or not. And also the hotel drier (i think it was a combined washer+drier) did not dry very well, again. And clothing was slightly wet still.</p>
<p>Check out of hotel, then walk around some touristy area because friend want to browse some sweets shops. I also got one of those fortune things that you put coin in box for payment and take a roll of paper for ur fortune. Idrk what the actual fortune said but i could understand stuff like my Lucky Color and Lucky Item of the day which was cool ig.</p>
<p>Also, went into some cafe, friend ate an apple pie and coffee. Eventually done with the area, walked down to MINAMI-OTARU station. Took some pictures n stuff on the way. Friend explained what camera APERTURE does to photos.</p>
<p>Took train one stop up to OTARU. Then get ready to transfer to another train to go further northwest. However some signs indicated that IC card would no longer work in that area. Thus it exited gates to buy tickets.</p>
<p>Friend was doing stuff with ATM but train leave soon, so i bought two peoples tickets valued for YOICHI. quickly went up stairs i believe. Train look like its about to leave i think. walk up to it. Train person said sth like “going to ? ?” and affirmed. And then they said “wait a minute” Im not sure to us or to the train driver(?) and idked who they said they words so i just stood there with friend until they pressed the door button for us and we went inside train.</p>
<p>I think this was the first “ONE MAN” train have ever taken. Actually it might have not technically been “ONE MAN” since i think there was conductor(?) also?. And actually i think train from SAPORO to OTARU might have been uh “one-man” technically. I do not know. However I think it was the first train i ever took that potentially stopped at unmanned stations. And I was unfamiliar with these kinds of trains. And as the train was making its stops I was slightly worried and confused about things. I believe I was worried that when train was making stops, people needed to go to front and present something to driver before getting off. However in retrospect this makes sense i believe. because they was probably getting off at unmanned stations(?) and thus needed to present they ticket <em>on</em> the train because nobody would check it <em>off</em> the train. thats my thoughts.</p>
<p>But eventually reached YOICHI and all the train doors opened and dont need to show train-aboard person anything. Just get off and go into station where a person was waiting to look, take ur ticket.</p>
<p>YOICHI was actually not the terminal station of the train we took. however i wanted to stop by because it had Sea-access. So we walked to the sea and i breifly saw the sea. The sea was nice. i walked in the water a bit. There was also a singular someone surfing in the water i believe.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Walked around back to the station. At this point it was 1:30pm i.e. time to eat lunch. But um i think everything seemed closed (many place close from around 2-5) or idrk what, decide to just eat at the next terminal station we would have to transfer at.</p>
<p>Took the train to the next terminal station, KUCCHAN. Got out the station wonder where to eat. End up eating probably most-close-to-station place that was open, which was some random “family restaurant”.</p>
<p>This family restaurant was the first time i ever ordered vocally in japanese i think. Woww!. We enter, and probably went through the usually IS YOU TWO PPL and stuff and SIT HERE/SIT WHEREVER YOU WANT process. i think they also brought out the menu on a clipboard i think. And then i believe when it was bringing over water i made it look like i intended to order and pointed to something and said <ruby>KORE FUTATU DE (ONEGAISIMASU)<rt>これ二つでお願いします</rt></ruby>. i actually dont know if <ruby>DE<rt>で</rt></ruby> is the correct particle in this situation but no matter since they probably could barely hear me anyway. And they said FUTATU? and i said yeah and they said OK and went away (or something like that. i actually dont think i remember much).</p>
<p>And then they served the food, which was like a whole fancy meal, i.e. they brought out a salad first and then we ate the salad and they brought out some soup in a cups and the main dish. It was quite yummy. Friend was especially impressed.</p>

<p>When it came time to payment i paymented which was stood up from chair and look ready to go (my chair was right next to payment counter). The person asked if paying together. i actually dont remember what the japanese was said except the phrase <ruby>ISSYO<rt>一緒</rt></ruby> and maybe <ruby>KAIKEI<rt>会計</rt></ruby> or sth but i used my interpretation skills to understood. And i replied something like <ruby>ISSYO DE<rt>一緒で</rt></ruby> with like sign language bringing the two index fingers together. And i paid the money. In my payment i included a 2000-YEN bill which seemed to induce absolutely zero reaction in the person. And friend showed them a positive message on google translate orso saying food was very delicious and hope their business does well. and we left.</p>
<section id="yen-bills" class="aside">
<h2>2000-yen bills</h2>
<p>i have never seen a 2000-yen bill and didnt know they even existed except for one time i was watching random japanese tv and they had a segment on them and said u can find them in okinawa and also in foreign currency exchange. “That is funny” i thought. Because i got foreign currency exchange in home. So I got some 2000-yen bills in home-country currency exchange by asking if they got any and i got them. And i thought it would be fun to pay with them in smaller businesses bc i assumed they were unusual bills. However in all the times i payed with them literally i dont think anyone was the least bit unusualed or surprised even though i kept them in crisp condition in an envelope in my bag with cardboard to prevent them from being bent.</p>
</section>
<p>After the meal we walked around town. KUCCHAN has a big mountain or hill (now that i look it up , it is a volcano) that u can see from it. Very cool.</p>

<p>Friend went coffee, we go to a cafe. Friend got coffee to-go, we walk back to station. A peaceful atmosphere.</p>
<p>We took the train to OSYAMAMBE. At one point sitting on the train i was slightly panicking checking my pockets and stuff for my train ticket, I could not find it. I remember i put it into right pocket, which was also pocket i store my phone. Did it fall out of my pocket earlier when i went outside take picture of train before departed with my phone?? oh no!.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>However an old dude sitting in seat across from us noticed, and nonverbally pointed to the floor beneath seat and i saw that it had dropped out of pocket onto floor. phew!. I nonverbally thanked the guy, I think. if that is possible.</p>
<p>We arrived at OSHAMAMBE and according to the schedule i am pretty sure there was supposed to be a train we could have taken right away. But it did not seem to come. And the arrivals board didnt say anything. And actually, I am not sure if we could have taken the train, because the train person took our tickets before we got off the train i think. I guess because the station was closed at that time?. Or uh idrk. It was quite confusing and stressful. However the train seemed to simply not exist, so decide to take the next train which did appear on arrivals board in 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Exited the train station (there was no gates or anything. no people on-duty at that time). Decide to walk over to a nearby grocery store to see if they had any prepared foods could consume. It seemed they did not. Also walked into a Tsuruha Drug also looking for food. And also i looked at the wet-wipes section. And we did not get anything, walk back to station.</p>
<figure>

<p>At the station used the ticket kiosk thing to purchase tickets for the next train thingy which was a special express thing. And with our tickets we then waited on the platform.</p>
<p>However it was very delayed. i think one thing mentioned that it was deer to deer collision ): .</p>
<p>Stood on the platform, it was cold. take some pictures. Bought a things from the warm section of the vending machine. I got a corn soup.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Eventually the train came. Enjoyed corn soup on the train along with a cheese biscuit that friend had.</p>
<p>Eventually arrive at our destination: HAKODATE station. When exiting station, friend discovered they had not they ticket. They wonder if they threw it away on accident when throwing away some stuff when getting off the train. So go back to the trash can. Some guy come out and hand over the ticket which had indeed been thrown away. Wow thanks that guy.</p>
<p>Exit hotel and look at a convenience store in station for food. They did not have self register and neither a too wide selection of food so went to Lawson short distance away, nearer the hotel we stay at. They also had no self register but oh well. Bought some food including some popcorn chicken from the hot-case because i saw person in front of us take us from the case and realised it was a self-take hotcase. I gave everything to friend to check out so i would not have to check out, hehe. Idk why we did not get a bag but we did not get a bag. I dont remember if it was bc they asked and we said no thx or we didnt understand them or what. But we didnt have a bag.</p>
<p>Check into hotel. The hotel room was kinda cool in that it had like a japanese-style raised section of the room but also standard western-style part with western-style beds. Interesting. room quite large. due to addition of that japanese-style section. Also out the window you could see the HAKODATE STATION very clearly, very cool.</p>

<p>I warmed up my boxed meal in the microwave located in the vending/laundry/microwave room right outside of our room. And ate it. I also had my popcorn chicken and juice box. It was very yummy overall.</p>
