<p>I arrived at Haneda airport. I went through immigration and customs and met my Friend who arrived at similar time and was waiting in Airport.</p>
<p>We walked around. Decide first thing to do was get sim card. I read online somewhere there was sim-card vending machine somewhere by the KEIKYU LINE area thing. We walked there, saw the machine, it looked expensive. So walked more to see if there was any other options.</p>
<p>We walked up from 2F to 3F (departures) looking for a seven-eleven bc I wanted to buy sim card there, but we couldnt find it (it was behind us). Instead I saw a BIC CAMERA up a floor or so we went up there. I went in looked at the sim cards. Bought a sim card, and also a cute travel toothbrush+paste+plastic case thing, the same one I bought in my 1st trip to Japan except it was like half the length and also pink. Friend waited outside figuring out buying they own ESIM thing I believe.</p>
<section id="how-was-the-checkout-like-progress-update" class="aside">
<h2>how was the checkout like? (progress update)</h2>
<p>I had’vst anxiety paying for stuff in Japan. I am not entirely sure why. However I can theorize. Perhaps it is because I am afraid of looking stupid when they ask me stuff and idk what they just said and I awkwardly try to look confused so they know that idk what they just said. Or perhaps it is because I am afraid of even if I understand and can roughly nonverbally respond to their dialogue they think I’m being rude due to my nonverbalness. And etc.</p>
<p>However I think that after many exposure therapy of checking out, the anxiety is slowly going down. Not sure. Or perhaps it went down specifically in this trip because have Friend Support or etc. I am not sure. Still have my good, and bad moments.</p>
<p>However this BIC CAMERA checkout was not too noteworthy. Average. I think I just put the stuff on the counter. they went to go find the sim card (represented by the cardboard card thing I brought to register) in a bunch of bins in the back. and they showed me some information sheet saying some stuff like “it is data only” and i forget what else. and I nodded. and I payed with credit card. and etc.</p>
</section>
<p>We both got the SIMs now and together we sat down and tried to find hotel to stay in.</p>
<p>We had tried look for hotel about a day before, however Tokyo hotel prices on the Weekend is quite high price and low availablility, at least compared with other days of week and other locations. Thus we decided that perhaps if we postponed our decision to even later, maybe price would slightly drop, or availibilty improve (last-minute cancellations?). However it was still quite high price and low availibility. Maybe slightly improved? But probably not.</p>
<p>Many times something looked like good and we clicked on “Book” button in Agoda app to book it. But then Agoda say something like “oops, someone already booked it”. Very unfortunate. Eventually we decided and successfully booked some place in <ruby>Mejiro<rt>目白</rt></ruby> and we went to take the KEIKYU LINE to it.</p>
<p>Rode the KEIKYU LINE to shinagawa and got off to transfer to uhh.. idrk. I did not really think of how to transfer trains. i just saw that MEJIRO was like 500-something(?) yen on the KEIKYU fare map in haneda airport, and thus I bought that-value ticket for Friend (who did not have cash or IC card yet), and we went on our way. However get off at shinagawa station, it was confusing. IIRCed the keikyu fare map had a loop resembled the JR YAMANOTE line which we would have to enter to get to MEJIRO. However how do we enter this loop? Was it transfer to another KEIKYU train which run parallel to JR YAMANOTE line? was it literally just transfer JR YAMANOTE? it was quite confusing. i stood there confused a while, and i believe friend was probably also confused, perhaps also confused why i was confused.</p>
<p>There was some points to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>it seemed the keikyu trains only went in two directions (towards and away from haneda airport). thus I was convinced that probably indeed had actually transfer companies (From KEIKYU to JR)</li>
<li>there were two largely labelled exit options:
<ol type="1">
<li>EXIT (the station)</li>
<li>TRANSFER (to JR)</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p>So it was tried that friend insert they KEIKYU ticket into the “transfer” gate. It did not work, probably because it was a KEIKYU ticket and idk why it would work. Some attendant said something to friend (idk what) and pointed in the direction of exit. idk what that meant. did we have to exit and repurchase a JR ticket? hmm. That would be possible, however it would waste several hundred yen because</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>the keikyu from HND to shinagawa only cost uhh 500 yen i think. and we had ticket worth 500-some yen. Thus lose that difference because no refund</li>
<li>JR ticket from shinagawa to mejiro is 200-some yen (210 i think?). thus we lose that money also unnecessarily because we are supposed to have a ticket already good to get to mejiro.</li>
</ol>
<p>But we strolled over in the direction and accidentally stumbled across something that made sense, which seemed to be a booth exchanging KEIKYU tickets for JR tickets. oh that made sense!. So, I took friend’s ticket and went up to the booth and said “mejiro” and they took ticket and probably said sth i didnt understand, and showed me 210(i think) on some register. so i thought: damn have to pay?? what?? oh well. and reached for wallet, but then guy was like “oh no thats just the ticket value im gonna give you” (i assume), and gave me the JR ticket. woww!! so nice.</p>
<p>And then with that JR ticket friend could go through transfer gate just fine and etc. how nice!. I was using IC card and all of the transfer was done automatically i think, how convenient.</p>
<p>Took YAMANOTE to mejiro. it was quite crowded, perhaps because a weekend night in tokyo.</p>
<p>We checked in to hotel and then exited hotel to look for food to eat.</p>
<p>Look around mejiro station but nothing really appealed.</p>
<p>Decide to walk northwards to IKEBUKURO to a MATSUYA and perhaps eat somewhere else if anywhere else appealed along the way.</p>
<p>Walked through some empty quiet nice peaceful streets was nice. eventually reached IKEBUKURO where we ate matsuya. and then we walked a little around IKEBUKURO, visited <ruby>MUJI<rt>無印良品</rt></ruby> where bought SOCKS and a PEN and look around a DON QUIJOTE because i wanted to look for rfid-blocking-sheet and/or a wallet and friend want look for a small bag. Dont buy anything, exit walk back, stop by MUJI because friend buy small bag there, walk back hotel peacefully. photographed a vending machine, walked on a bridge, etc. also stopped by some convenience stores buy some travel supplies.</p>

<section id="the-rfid-blocking-thing" class="aside">
<h2>The rfid-blocking thing</h2>
<p>I wanted to put my IC (transportaiton) card in the back of my phone so that dont have to carry card separately. just tap back of phone to ride train. however i tried this before didnt work, maybe because phone electronic mess with IC card thing, not really sure. However i looked up and they got a thing you can put between your phone and IC card to prevent that from happen. RFID-blocking sheet? IC card error prevention sheet. something like that. i wanted that. and i spent many times first few days look for it.</p>
</section>
<p>back at hotel, washing, brush teeth, sleep (probably). i believe also i really had to use the bathroom while friend was using bathroom to wash but luckily nothing bad happened.</p>
