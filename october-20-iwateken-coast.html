<p>Today i got up and it was time to go to the TATEHANA WHARF MORNING MARKET!. so i gathered my stuff to check out. and however there was free breakfast offered by hotel. so i stopped by there and had some breakfast. they had some nice side dishes u put in ur tray and u can get some rice and soup. They had this one kind of soup that i forget what its named but i think supposedly its um a specialty of the region which was cool. and it tasted good.</p>

<p>Took the train to the MORNING MARKET, friend was still getting ready to go in their own hotel i believe. Arrive at the MORNING MARKET, maybe a bit later than i hoped/planned but it was cool. I walked around. there was idol group performance by specifically an idol group representing the morning market which was pretty crazy and cool. walked around the entire market, eventually friend arrived and met them and we walked around a bit, and i got them to buy me some citrus (with my own money). Shortly the market was closing down so left.</p>

<h2>got handed some kind of probably politial flyer</h2>
<p>someone was holding political idk speech or what across the street and friend stopped to take pictures and i stopped to take a picture of friend taking pictures and someone gave us fliers for that person im guessing</p>
</section>
<p>Walked back to the nearby station where friend bought takoyaki from some tent and let me eat one and then we bought ticket and waited for train to KUJI. tbh i dont really remember what happened on way to KUJI i think i was tired. Arrived KUJI and we went to the other train station buy our ticket for the ticket we will need to go further south. Still had some time before that train come, so we walked around KUJI town a bit. Area around station felt pretty empty, esp for a sunday afternoon (actually idk if sunday afternoon supposed to have a lot of ppl outside). Friend went to an aesthetic-interior coffee shop i followed them in. sat at a table and they gave us english menu, friend ordered a coffee to-go. Got it, walked back to station.</p>

<p>I had to use the bathroom so i jogged back to station so would have time to use bathroom and then board train. Finished use bathroom, friend say they already board train so i went to go find train. There was no person checking tickets at the station so i just go to the platforms. Temporarily was confused, but then found the train and boarded.</p>
<p>It was a cute train decorated like a sightseeing attraction. also all the passengers look like old people going on sightseeing. idk if they actually were. They also had little toy train controls at the front and back of train you can fiddle with, that was cool.</p>

</figure>
<p>Ride the train, get off at Noda Village. During pre-trip planning i wanted to got to Noda because it was a Village and i dont think i had ever visited a place in Japan classified as Village. And also when looking at it in more detail it looked like it had a cute character mascot called Non-chan that could be seen in various places, so that looked fun to see.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>We got off the train and go to place that we had planned to eat, except it looked to be closed. Oops!. Look at google maps and etc., walk and eventually find a place to eat lunch. It was a cozy, family-restaurant kind of vibe. Also there was only a Japanese menu i think. Also i saw a menu with simply a gazillion different types of fish listed so i wonder if it had some nice fish. but we did not get fish.</p>
<p>The large CHAASYUUMEN i had was quite very large, like probably the largest bowl of noodles ive had in my life, i did not expect “large” to be that large. However was pretty tasty. Except for some reason near the end of eating it it kinda tasted bitter. idk why, maybe its bc i like ate so much salt that my taste buds started malfunctioning or sth.</p>

<p>After eat, we went to a park labelled on google maps as “Nonchan park”. however there were kids playing at it so i couldnt really play on the playground myself which was kind of sad. Or i guess i technically could have but that would have been kinda weird. But there was a stream and some rocks so i touched those.</p>
<p>And then we went to the Non-chan parking lot, and then walked to another Non-chan park. We also used the public toilet there.</p>

<p>And then i wanted to walk along the beach so we walked over to the beach. Except there is this giant barrier, i believe to help prevent tsunami damage, so we walked along the road and stuff until there was an access point to the beach. And i walked along the beach, and friend walked on the walkway on the giant barrier thing. the beach was very pebbly and my feet kinda hurt by all the pebbles, but it was nice. Keep walk. Eventually the beach ended and exited the beach.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Walk along the road south towards a train station. I was following behind friend. And then i saw there was a small road branching off, and based on google maps satellite view it looked like i could walk along the shore there maybe, so i went there. Friend keep walking on, i text them im gonna walk along the shore. There was like a um pole thing? blocking the way? but not very authoritatively so idrk what its significance was so i just went under it.</p>
<p>The shore had a lot of rocks of various sizes and i sort of had to scramble across them. after nearly slipping and feeling like i might break some bones falling the wrong way i sort of scrambled my way along the rocks using my hands. The scenery was nice because there was the ocean and the ocean was nice. Also based on random trash i saw among the rocks i assumed if i continued down the shore i could indeed exit somewhere to a road.</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/20241020_150929.webp" alt="" /><figcaption>stuff i walked over</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>However after scrambling for a while i reached a point that did not look land-crossable which was unfortunate, so i turned back, scrambled the entire way back from where i came from, and continued down the regular road way.</p>
<p>Feeling grateful for having all my bones intact, i continued down the road through mountain, forest, finally arrive at the train station where friend was waiting.</p>
<p>We waiting to take the train down to MIYAKO. Due to some maintanence or sth we gotta get off midway and transfer to a bus, this was communicated to us via the posting of some information at the station we come from (NODATAMAGAWA).</p>
<p>So the train come, we take the <ruby>ticket<rt>整理券</rt></ruby> from the box and sit on the train.</p>
<p>Eventually the station come where we must transfer or something. Tbh i wish we had gotten off last so we could just follow other ppl and know what was going on. But we got off first, and I led the way out of the train. I was guessing that we needed to pay the fare to get off here, idrk why, so i brought a 1000-yen bill up to the change machine which i had never used on public transport bc i was short on coins and put it in to get my change. And i showed ticket to the train guy. And he said sth that i did not understand at all like i literally did not comprehend any syllable he said i was just concerned about if the change machine actually worked. And then i like tilted my head to indicated idk what he just said and he kept saying stuff until he said sth like <ruby>どこまで行きますか<rt>wheres ur final destination</rt></ruby> or something and friend said miyako and then he explained to us (in japanese) something that was probably Go Transfer To The Bus thing. and handed ticket back.</p>
<p>So we went to go to the bus, got to the bus. Sat on the bus. Wait for rest of passengers, and the train guy to arrive. And the bus depart.</p>
<p>Train guy started announcing stuff that i did not understand and which slightly concerned me bc he said sth like raise ur hand if ??? and like what was the ??? did we needed to raise our hand?? etc. However, after several times of listening, i began to interpret that this bus was literally the train now and was driving down to miyako and each time he was announcing it was “please raise ur hand if ur getting off here”. Very cool.</p>
<p>Eventually reach the <ruby>Final Stop<rt>shoe ten</rt></ruby> miyako, i let friend get off before me, and the final process was to Hand them the <ruby>Ticket<rt>整理券</rt></ruby> and they pulled out a fare chart and calculated the fare and hand them the fare and thats it. cool!.</p>
<p>Then walking around miyako thinking abt where to eat, decide to take bus to hotel area before busses stop running; there was a ramen place at hotel area anyway so go eat there.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Take the bus to hotel area, first go to eat at the ramen place. i was slightly intimidated because i had never been into a ramen establishment in japan i didnt know if the system here would be different from other restaurants or sth. But it was not. friend ordered; thank you friend. The place vibes was good. It had a TV going in the background. Seem like family business, and the small child was seated on one of the counter seats. People eating.</p>
<p>Tbh i do not like ramen very much, and this ramen did not really change my mind. The fried rice and dumplings was nice though. Overall a nice meal and vibes after a long day of travel, and a nice reward for not breaking my bones on the rocks earlier.</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/20241020_191123.webp" alt="" /><figcaption>food</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I paid, i remember i used a 2000-yen bill, and again nothing happened. We left.</p>
<p>We checked into the hotel. This was like one of only times ever in Japan have i ever been checked in and the person continued speaking Japanese after receiving a foreign passport but they did speak japanese and occasionally lapsed into some english phrases to explain stuff, like “Big Bath” i believe to explain they had a big public bath we can use.</p>
<p>We also got a physical room key (in the sense you stick it in a lock and turn it) which is the third time ive used a physical room key in Japan i think, which was also cool. And also we got a breakfast voucher to eat breakfast tomorrow.</p>
<p>Enter the room, the vibes was very cool. Big japanese-style room. Probably coolest room ive ever stayed in in Japan. Had big window can see moon, some water.</p>
<p>We decide go to the Big Bath. i like Big Bath because it is easier than preparing ur own bath and it is bigger. It was sort of unclear whether we should wear the slippers provided in the room through the hallways down to the Big Bath, or if we should wear our own shoes. It was still not clear after the experience so oh well.</p>
<p>We went to the Big Bath. there was no one in the Big Bath. we enjoyed the Big Bath, it was nice.</p>
<p>After we took the big bath, went back to room, and then came back down to lobby to utilize the Alcohol Vending Machine. I got a sour sour and a sweet sour, and they both was quite yummy. I had no snack to eat it with unfortunately and i wasnt about to go out to get it even though probably could have since i think there was a Lawson across the street. i ate a CITRUS FRUIT or two had from market with the alcohol. Watching the TV.</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/20241020_205406.webp" alt="" /><figcaption>dranking alcohol and mindlessly look at tv. what a life!</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This was perhaps one of peak moments in trip. After travelling halfway across the coast of IWATE-KEN and not accidentally shattering ankle, eat at good-vibes small restaurant, check into good-vibes hotel, sip on alcohol sitting on the floor in the bath clothes watching TV. A true experience. i remember on the TV, among other things, came on this program where it was presenting scenarios and discussing who was at fault or sth</p>
<p>At some point, brush teeth and stuff, go to bed. With the lights on i think bc friend was using phone.</p>
<section id="getting-along-with-friend" class="aside">
<h2>getting along with friend</h2>
<p>travelling with friend i think we was pretty chill with each other. idk about friend but i was pretty chill with friend. except a little times around this time, i believe i was slightly annoyed at Him for constantly walking ahead, and also whistling. also once i was trying to take video of train arriving but He kept making noises so i dont take the video. i did not tell Him i was annoyed stop whilsting please or please be quiet im trying to take video, or this night also please stop walking so i can take picture of this empty street, so tbh i do not blame Him for doing any of the things very much. and also idk why i was even annoyed at the whistling but i remember i felt so while also being confused why i was annoyed at it. and also yesterday during dinner friend said something: do you think they think we are japanese, and i said: no, and among other reasons why i said no they probably dont think we are, i said when the friend ordered food, some of words sounded like accent. and unfortunately i think that stuck with Him negatively, and today lunch i remember He mentioned something about that, and then tonight dinner after He ordered He said: i feel most confident in japanese ordering right now. my least confident was after you say i have accent. and that was an oopsies and i apologised because that was not nice of me.</p>
<p>And so we had those kind of silent or gentle conflict i guess. I think this conflicts if it could be called so peaked on this day. But after this tonight after experience the very “chill” atmosphere of</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>ramen shop</li>
<li>hotel</li>
<li>hotel bath</li>
<li>alcohol</li>
<li>hotel room</li>
</ol>
<p>it also valleyed this tonight, i.e. felt like disappeared, and i personally do not remember feeling any much “conflicts” rest of trip. I cannot speak for friend, and i dont actually know if they felt any conflicts. i actually never mentioned any of my annoyance so they will probably discover by reading this.</p>
